Hayley
Hey, it's Hayley here (from tinder)

27/07/2014 23:11:32

Me
Hey Hayley, its Joe (but not from Tinder, who the heck are you?)

27/07/2014 23:12:16

Me
:)

27/07/2014 23:12:46

Hayley
Ahh don't scare me! I thought I'd got the wrong number!!

27/07/2014 23:13:48

Hayley
So, was Dickens right? How comes you live there? Not up for moving to London? Yeh I've always lived here, born and raised :). 

I lived in Edinburgh last summer so went to the festival for the first time then. Was so awesome that my friend and I made a pact that we'd go back this year. It's the Royal Military Tattoo, and its bloody awesome. It's loadsa different acts from around the world, but my favourite part is the bagpipes and drummers! It's just so awesome hearing them all play together! 

My weekend was much the same as yours it appears. The most I did all weekend was join tinder...

27/07/2014 23:28:58

Me
Ha sorry ;)
Mostly. That's probably why I like London so much. I'm currently looking, but I might have to save up for a bit. Found a small shoebox near Canary Wharf a little while ago, but it was taken quickly. Soon!

You lived there? What's the story behind that? The jealousy's getting pretty serious now, jeez. I'll have to make a point to go when I get the chance.

To be fair, joining Tinder as an attractive girl is probably a weird enough experience for one weekend. How's the experience so far?

27/07/2014 23:36:16

Hayley
Yeh rent prices are completely ridiculous, I'm at home at the moment to save up but hoping to move out at some point. Slight restricted by my crappy student researcher salary though, grrr. 
Yeh, I did an internship at KPMG there last summer, bit too far to commute so moved up there for a bit :). I'm jealous of myself to be honest... But yeh you must! 
Yeh it probably is, I wouldn't know... Lol. But yeh s'been good so far, I really don't like judging people on their appearance though... But I guess there's no way round it. How've you found tinder so far? Been on many dates?

27/07/2014 23:43:19

Me
Sorry, I will respond, just half asleep and up at godawful o clock for work. Just so you know I'm not ignoring you :) Night X

27/07/2014 23:43:58

Hayley
No problem, sleep well :).x

28/07/2014 18:13:37

Me
It'll be worthwhile, better to spend a bit longer saving now than later.
Still, you do start to go a bit stir-crazy after a while :)
It sounds like (crappy salary aside) you really enjoy the job. What's the trains thing about do you think?

You're being very humble. I do completely agree about the shallowness thing. It boils everything down until there's very little humanity left, it does feel a bit disposable and even a little mean-spirited. That said, it's all voluntary. I've met a few people, but I'm not really looking for a one-night type of thing, which seems unusual for tinder. I bet there's a healthy number of creeps you've met already, right?

28/07/2014 18:27:51

Hayley
Yeh I'm starting to enjoy it more now, had quite an extended settling in period where I didnt know for sure if its what I want to be doing... Still not 100% sure but s'all good for now :). 
What do you mean by the trains thing?

Yes, mean spirited, that describes it perfectly! And I'm worried that it's gonna make us all that bit more judgemental of others and their appearance, but hey ho. And as you said, it's voluntary. I'm not looking for that either, and it's really hard to tell what other people's intentions are and I don't want to get myself into any situations where that is going to be assumed, but I guess that's a risk you gotta take. (Hope I'm making sense).

So far so good, I've not actually met anyone yet cos i only got this 2days ago, but people seem nice enough. Unless you're a creep in disguise...? :P

28/07/2014 18:53:58

Me
I know what you mean. Until that penthouse flat, it'll have to do for now.
I thought you said that you like trains? Just wondered whether that was more about liking your job or being a full on trainspotter :)

There's plenty about the modern world that makes me feel like a crotchety old man, but it is pretty bad. Not sure we're quite in it yet, but that hunger games dystopia is comin' I tells ya!

Can't promise I'm not a creep (but I do hope I'm not). For what it's worth, I hope you're not a 65 year old man. That would be weird.

28/07/2014 19:01:02

Hayley
Man I wish I was a full on trainspotter! Problem is I don't have the time or the inclination haha. But it would be awesome. I'd love to care that much about something! 

Hah, the only good thing about the hunger games movie was Wes Bentleys' beard!! 

I do hope you're not a creep  too... Yeh that really would be weird. But I'm actually a 43 year old man so you dodged a bullet there!

28/07/2014 20:37:59

Me
You've got pretty much the perfect job for it. Can you imagine how good life would be? Every crappy rainy Monday morning would be awesome. They've got it figured out.

I don't know who Wes Bentley is, but I know exactly which beard you're talking about. The cake decorating camouflage bit was enough for me to give up on it.

Nah, I'm pretty sure I'm normal. Ish. A 43 year old? Meh, could be worse, I guess. We should meet up for a coffee/ lawn bowls sometime :)

28/07/2014 21:25:54

Hayley
Wes Bently is the dude who played the creepy dude in American Beauty, and the crazy beard dude! 

Ish is good enough for me! Hehe. Yeh that'd be cool!! But they only play lawn bowls during the day, so you either have to be unemployed or retired...

28/07/2014 22:38:49

Me
Ah, I haven't seen that movie, just the clip of Spacey in the drive through window being awesome. Fun fact: my (at the time, very prudish) parents rented that movie, having heard how amazing it was. They got halfway through and switched it off, disgusted, couldn't see what all the fuss was about.

They'd rented American Pie by mistake. I swear that's true.

There goes that plan. I was hoping we could race zimmerframes and win big on the bingo.
Just the coffee it is, then. How's Saturday?

28/07/2014 23:05:35

Hayley
That. Is. Bloody. Hilarious!!!! Haha!

You should check it out though it's pretty good. Me and my sister used to literally watch it every days for a couple of months when we first discovered it. Think we might have had a wee crush on Mr Bentley...

Oooh that sounds so fun though :(, we gotta do that one day!
Yeep, coffee sounds great. Sat doesnt work cos im going to be in Edinburgh until Sunday. Will probs have to be some time next week now?

28/07/2014 23:09:31

Hayley
That or tomorrow, although I'm not free until after 8...

28/07/2014 23:16:24

Me
Ah, sorry, I'm being extremely thick. You'll be having an awesome time in Edinburgh then.
New job, lots to learn, brain dead, yada yada excuses.
Next week sounds good, maybe next Saturday?
I'll take this as a sign I need to reboot my brain. Night Hayley! X

28/07/2014 23:19:27

Hayley
No worries. I'm away next Saturday aswell... (Norway this time). How about some time during the week after work? 
Night night, sleep tight :).x

28/07/2014 23:36:16

Me
Haha sounds like we're both pretty busy :) Edinburgh then Norway? Living the life! After work next week would be good. Thursday?

28/07/2014 23:37:29

Hayley
Thursday :)

31/07/2014 17:43:26

Hayley
Greetings from Edinburgh! How are you? :)

31/07/2014 19:16:20

Me
Very well! Today is deadline day for a major software release my team's been working on, so it's been pretty crazy. Meeting up with a friend now because Liverpool St is blocked. Need to get you on the case! How's it going up there?

31/07/2014 20:49:39

Hayley
Lol, and those closures are actually the precise topic I'm working on :). Must be a relief to get past the deadline! It's going pretty good thanks! Been to a few good shows today :). Favourite joke so far: When I proposed to my wife I went down on one knee, to which she replied: why're you licking my knee?!

31/07/2014 20:49:47

Hayley
(To be read in a Scottish accent)

01/08/2014 22:30:57

Me
Sorry about the radio silence, it's been crazy. Lots still happening, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't quite like it.
That said, I'm very jealous of you! Any names I might've heard of? Oh, and have you seen the tattoo yet?
That's a good one :) There's something about the Scottish accent.
My brain has apparently ceased activity for the day, so I can't respond in kind. Do me a favour, and imagine I've come up with something really witty and with the perfect balance of flirt and charm. Yeah. Smooth.

02/08/2014 00:24:21

Hayley
No probs! Hope it's all going well :). Nah probably not, I hadn't even heard of most of them myself... Thinking of going to see a big name tomorrow but not sure who yet... Mostly going to the free shows atm! And yes!!! We went to the tattoo last night, and it was literally so gosh damn awesome! I'm so inspired that I might start taking bagpipe lessons...!
Haha ok will do! But next time you gotta come up with something for reals!

03/08/2014 21:14:06

Me
It's really bad

03/08/2014 21:16:04

Me
Here goes: 

I once went on a date with a girl who didn't swallow.
Soup everywhere.

To be fair, you did have a ton of comedians to provide yours :)
How was it? X

03/08/2014 21:19:31

Hayley
It took you two days to come up with that?! I guess it is relatively funny ;). 
And yeh that is fair... New favourite: what's the biggest kitchen utensil?

It was aweeeeeesome. But tiring too. Can't wait for my beeed! How's your weekend?x

03/08/2014 21:28:55

Me
Generous, thanks :)
Go on, what's the biggest kitchen utensil?

Looking forward to hearing about it on Thursday. Where are you working/ when do you finish?

It's been pretty good, 2 barbecues. The optimal amount, in my opinion x

03/08/2014 21:43:25

Me
Yeah, and I joke challenge you. No cheating this time, either! :)

03/08/2014 22:11:58

Hayley
Ma-sieve! Hehehhe. Hilarious right?! 

Thursday I'm working I Holborn but have a meeting with my supervisor at uni at 5. (Uni is near warrent street/euston). 
Optimal barbeques, sweeet! 

Challenge accepted!

03/08/2014 22:13:41

Hayley
And hey, I didn't cheat!! I simply recalled a joked I'd previously heard... That's how joke telling works bruv :P

03/08/2014 22:50:48

Me
Oh good lord. Ma-Sieve. Of course.

Unfortunately, my sense of humour is a little twisted.
For example- Michael J Fox is a glass half full type of guy. 
Always.

For Thursday, I demand a real one (or at least a fake one told with a solid veneer of believability) :)

03/08/2014 23:17:04

Hayley
Not sure whether I should admit to not getting that joke... (Dont judge me).

A real what? Joke? I didn't know there was such a thing as a fake joke...! So confused ��

03/08/2014 23:30:24

Me
This is the problem with texting! All the subtleties and non-verbal bits aren't there. By real, I mean you really came up with it, or if you didn't, lie convincingly. That's probably indicative of a deeper psychological issue, come to think of it...

Michael J Fox has Parkinson's, which causes him to shake violently. He's also very charismatic and positive about his situation, so saying that he's *always* a glass-half-full type of guy is cruelly ironic. I recognise that I am a bad person :)

04/08/2014 08:33:40

Me
Oh, and are you a redditor, by any chance? :)

04/08/2014 08:49:36

Me
For Thursday, I'll find a list of best coffee shops in London and try out #1. Fancy it? :)

04/08/2014 15:39:54

Hayley
Oooh right. I didn't know it was a thing to actually come up with your own jokes... I just re-tell the ones I hear! Not sure id be much good at it either, and I'm really bad at lying so probs wouldn't be very convincing to try and pass them off as my own... 

Hehe that is funny, I just didn't have all the facts! I guess I don't stalk Michael J Fox as much as you..! 

Nah I'm not a 'redditor'. If by that you mean someone that uses/posts on reddit.

And yeh that sounds cool for thursday!! Just make sure it'll be open after work still :):).

04/08/2014 22:16:59

Me
You made a pretty good point... :) Coffee shops are generally closed (aside from the Riding House cafe) but I think we should go to the Lucky Pig instead. It's at number 5 Clipstone Street, meet you there for 6? X

04/08/2014 23:26:40

Hayley
Awesome, sounds good, see you then :)

06/08/2014 18:45:50

Hayley
Hey hey, we still good for tomorrow?

06/08/2014 18:47:40

Me
Was just texting you! All good, just need to push it back to 6.20? Looking forward to it :)

06/08/2014 18:50:21

Hayley
Hah, great minds eh :). Sure thats cool. Are we meeting inside the place or outside?

(Also I don't know why but I feel like I should warn you that I'll be carrying a very large very un-attractive backpack, but hopefully you won't judge me on my accessories).

06/08/2014 18:56:19

Me
Outside is probably better, I think it's sort of underground? Never been, have you?
I'll reserve judgment until I see it :) Joke about I'll just be carrying emotional baggage, etc etc

06/08/2014 19:01:17

Hayley
Ah right, outside it is :). Nah never been, it looks cool though ! Was it a recommendation from someone?

06/08/2014 19:22:45

Me
I've heard of it before, it's well reviewed and on my hitlist. I was also a bit of an idiot and forgot that most coffee places would be shut. Still want to get to Kaffeine sometime though. Have you got a list too?

06/08/2014 20:03:27

Hayley
Took me a few seconds to figure out that that wasn't a typo... Hehe. Erm, I don't think I do have a list actually - I'm sure i used to though! So I've either ticked everything off or i gave up on it. One or the other, probably the latter :).

06/08/2014 21:51:22

Me
You'll have to rediscover it :) See you tomorrow x

07/08/2014 22:21:10

Me
Let me know when you get home safe x

07/08/2014 22:33:50

Hayley
Alrighty. You too :)

07/08/2014 23:27:59

Hayley
Homeee. How you getting on?

07/08/2014 23:41:53

Me
Just got in. Really enjoyed meeting you, Hayley, I'd like to do it again sometime. Probably better with food. Night :)

07/08/2014 23:42:37

Hayley
Yes, food :). Nighty night.x

08/08/2014 12:45:51

Me
Thinking about your weird bowling thing, Bloomsbury Bowling looks good for next Saturday. (I reserve the right to use rails/ the launcher thing they have for toddlers)

08/08/2014 12:54:56

Hayley
Hey, it's not weird, its awesome and cool! But i'm still gonna be away next Saturday :(

08/08/2014 14:51:32

Me
Tomato, tomato. That saying doesn't really work over text... Ah right, you did say. You're back the next weekend, right? X

08/08/2014 15:20:50

Hayley
Haha! Yeh it doesnt quite... I'm back Monday the 18th :)

08/08/2014 22:06:39

Me
That Wednesday then. When do you finish work? X

08/08/2014 22:08:07

Me
We'll of course have to get something to eat this time... :)

08/08/2014 22:13:07

Hayley
Woo Wednesday works. I'll be free from about 5.30 :).

08/08/2014 22:40:00

Me
I like the woo :) 
Looking forward to it. Night Hayley x

19/08/2014 20:36:24

Hayley
Hey, have you booked the lane for tomorrow? I think there are only a few at Bloomsbury and they recommended booking :). I don't mind doing it if ya like.x

19/08/2014 20:37:37

Me
Already sorted, we've got a lane from 6-7 :)

19/08/2014 20:38:29

Hayley
Someone's organised! Awesome :). See you then then.x

19/08/2014 20:46:16

Me
Maybe I did learn something other than reef knots in the scouts. There's also an American diner with a burger voted 2nd best in London :) See you tomorrow x

19/08/2014 20:50:24

Hayley
Reef knots are for pussies :PP. You mean the diner that's attached to it? Been there for karaoke, bowling and cocktails, will be good to have the whole set!

19/08/2014 21:22:13

Me
Sacrilege! I never once considered that there might be cool and uncool knots. Cliques everywhere. What's wrong with the trusty reef?
There's a couple of options, sounds good, and there's a London Cocktail bar nearby I've heard is good x

19/08/2014 21:27:25

Hayley
Nowt wrong with the reef, I'm just more partial to a sexy sheepshank :). I'm cool with anything :). x

19/08/2014 22:11:16

Me
Talking about knots?
Bit kinky. Night Hayley x

19/08/2014 22:58:17

Hayley
Just realised that that actually sounds quite wrong... Eh well. Night!x

20/08/2014 17:35:11

Me
Really sorry, running a bit late. Be there for 6 x

20/08/2014 17:41:39

Hayley
No probs :)

20/08/2014 18:04:11

Me
Just up the road x

20/08/2014 18:05:03

Hayley
Okie doke :)

21/08/2014 00:22:14

Hayley
Please let me know when you get home safe. Thanks for a really nice evening :).xx

21/08/2014 00:44:50

Me
Same to you. Mine's going to be a bit late :s Had a great time. Looking forward to seeing you again :) x

21/08/2014 00:56:11

Hayley
I'm home :). Hope you manage to get enough sleep! See you soon :):).xx

21/08/2014 01:50:11

Me
Home. Just found out I got the last train :)

21/08/2014 01:50:14

Me
Night x

21/08/2014 09:01:45

Hayley
�� thank gosh we said goodbye when we did!

21/08/2014 13:26:04

Me
Tired today but worth it :) how are you getting on?

21/08/2014 14:35:10

Hayley
Tired also, and lacking the motivation to be productive... But yep, worth it :)

21/08/2014 18:06:01

Me
So when are we doing it again? Are you busy Saturday? X

21/08/2014 18:14:05

Hayley
Ermmmm, not sure about Saturday atm, can I let you know ? :)

21/08/2014 18:52:31

Me
No worries :) He got great results, btw. Very happy brother x

21/08/2014 19:20:43

Hayley
Wooo! Congrats to your bro! :):):)

21/08/2014 19:21:43

Hayley
I just went for a run (which by the way is terribly hard work when you only eat toast for lunch) and I dropped my iPod while crossing the road and then had to watch it get run over :(. Bad times.

21/08/2014 20:03:26

Me
Sorry to hear that :( Can you use your phone?
Chips and toast aren't the most nutritious foods. (Need pate for that). I'm pretty sure the raspberry? in the cocktail doesn't really count either :)

21/08/2014 20:15:30

Hayley
S'alright, still works, screens just smashed. Lol pate. Hmm yeh the *strawberry* probably didn't count, but I had a banana with my weetabix this morning so I've got that going for me :)

21/08/2014 20:55:09

Me
That's not quite so bad. No cars in gyms :) The banana's a good start. Doing better than me, I'm hoping that coffee beans count... Probably not x

21/08/2014 21:36:23

Hayley
Very true, there are no cars in gyms... But there's also no fresh air or wide open spaces to enjoy running through..! Hmm, coffee beans might count, they do grow on trees after all! How was your day in the end? Hope you were tooo tired.x

21/08/2014 22:11:53

Me
You've got a point there. Ever thought about doing a tough mudder run? My friend Sam's started saying he wants to do one, may have to start running more :/ Today was good, but just happened to have a surprise one on one assessment meeting with my manager, and had to present the new system we've been designing to one of the bigwig business guys. Luckily, I think he approves. See, wasn't so bad. How did yours go? Must've gotten motivated if you went for a run :) x

21/08/2014 22:26:13

Hayley
Well actually my friend recently suggested that we should do something like that, Push it for Peace I think it was called. Looks fun but don't know if I'm physically capable ! 
Oh right, nice of them to spring that on you!! Glad it went well :). My day was pretty much a write off, will have to work over the weekend to make up for it, but it's my own fault, I shoulda forced myself to go into uni. Working from home doesn't work unless you have something specific to get on with. The run was about the most productive thing I did all day, oh and I hung the new curtains in my room, they're hideous...x

21/08/2014 22:46:14

Me
That sounds like it's actually for a good cause. I'm sure you'd be fine, pushing yourself to do something a bit crazy is the whole idea :) 
Working from home's tough, far too many easy distractions. Especially with the internet. Literally everything's on there. Very easy to be distracted by everything.
Maybe they'll grow on you?... Or you can liberate your room of them once you get it back.
Barely awake now, so I might collapse for a bit. Night x

22/08/2014 09:10:27

Hayley
Apologies, musta drifted off myself. Yep, not risking it today, heading into uni and I'm totally going to be super duper productive! Might do the liberation thing, but on the other hand curtains can sometimes come in handy... Anyway, hope you have a good day :).x

22/08/2014 17:54:59

Me
No worries. Sorry about the delay myself, had a desk lunch with the team. All went fairly well, meetings and prototyping. Yawn.
Curtains have their uses. Wait wha...
Been told that tomorrow my brother Sam's coming back from France, so I'd find that one a bit difficult now too :( 
How was your super productive day? X

22/08/2014 18:03:02

Hayley
Why yawn? All sounds good :). Yeh curtains, keep the room dark and that innit... Woo Sam's coming back! What would you find difficult?? My super productive day was... Ok... Not as bad as yesterday, but still not working to the standard I'd like. But it's ok, I'm gonna give myself and metaphorical slap and get the Fuck on with it from now on! :)

22/08/2014 18:24:10

Me
It's actually really fun, just lots going on and ready for the weekend now.
Difficult to come to London tomorrow, think I'm driving and we've got some family round as a welcome party.
Good good. You know you mean serious business when Fuck is capitalised. You got this. Get some work done so we can meet up again :)

22/08/2014 18:31:45

Hayley
Oh riight, no worries. I probs couldn't make it anyway. Some time next week will have to do :). Oh, that capital F was accidental... My phone must know what I'm thinking though! We're meeting up whether I've done any work or not :), but thanks for the motivation :).

24/08/2014 13:43:39

Me
Hey you :) Meet at Marble Arch tomorrow at 3.30 X

24/08/2014 13:58:45

Me
May have to change plans a bit if it does rain x

24/08/2014 14:18:28

Hayley
3.30?! Oh yeh it's bank holiday!!! Should be ok. What's the plan ? :)

24/08/2014 15:11:45

Me
Alright for some, eh? :) Have to wait and see. Hope you're having a good weekend x

24/08/2014 16:01:18

Hayley
I was just going to rock up to work like normal and pretend it wasn't bank holiday, but this sounds much more fun :). Having a bloody lovely weekend thanks. hope you are too x

25/08/2014 11:54:24

Me
Adjusting slightly due to rain :( when was the last time you went to the British museum? X

25/08/2014 12:04:31

Hayley
Probably about a year ago - defs plenty more to see though! Yeh it's not looking great and doesn't appear to be any more promising later on. Should we maybe postpone to a day when there aren't weather warnings issued? :P

25/08/2014 12:13:31

Hayley
Actually, a bit of rain never hurt anyone! Meeting time / place?!

25/08/2014 12:16:15

Me
You always do what you're told? :D (4hrs from now, we may regret it) x

25/08/2014 12:16:41

Me
With my grandparents, so I'll figure out when I get a min :)

25/08/2014 12:18:36

Hayley
I'm confused, do you wanna postpone? I'm good either way.x

25/08/2014 12:30:10

Me
I'm still game :). Do you know where the nearest station to the British Museum is? There at 3.30 x

25/08/2014 12:35:29

Hayley
Cool beans. I think it's Russel square :). Alrighty, see you then!

25/08/2014 14:01:38

Me
Looking forward to it. Is 4 alright? Stuck in traffic x

25/08/2014 14:12:14

Hayley
Sure no probs. It closes at 5.30 though!! :):)

25/08/2014 15:44:09

Me
Got here a little early, see you soon x

25/08/2014 23:29:33

Me
Really glad we met, Hayley. Let me know when you get home safe x

25/08/2014 23:32:14

Hayley
:) me too. Will do. You get the train ok?

25/08/2014 23:34:49

Me
Yeah, they're running until about half 12 most days (bit later at the weekends I think). Hope it isn't raining for the walk home. No creeps around your train, I hope? :)

25/08/2014 23:36:24

Hayley
Oh cool, I meant are you on it or waiting? Rain seems ok, couldn't have been like this before eh?! And no creeps so far, none obviously anyway.x

25/08/2014 23:42:24

Me
On it, at Stratford now :) on yours? Would've made the ridiculously long walks a little easier. Hopefully it dries up a bit for Friday. Anywhere you particularly want to try? X

26/08/2014 00:23:28

Hayley
Oops, I'm home :). Nothing comes to mind, as I said I'm good with anything. If you're fed up of choosing though i can come up with something.x

26/08/2014 00:25:58

Me
Nah, I've got some ideas. Do want to try Purl at some point though... :) Night x

26/08/2014 00:27:05

Hayley
Cool cool. Nighty night x

26/08/2014 07:53:09

Me
Hey, did you say yesterday you'd had trouble sleeping? I've got something that'll help. Search YouTube for "ephemeral rift pineapple". Put your phone on wifi only, put some headphones in and watch it in bed. (Just got to trust me on this one :)

26/08/2014 08:00:25

Hayley
Alrighty, will give it a go tonight :)

26/08/2014 17:49:09

Me
My mum's just asked me to pour a bucket of ice water over her later... :)

26/08/2014 17:51:53

Me
Fair warning, if she nominates me...

26/08/2014 17:52:22

Me
You're gonna get wet. Couldn't resist, sorry

26/08/2014 17:55:11

Hayley
Hahaa, s'alright, suppose that was too good an opportunity to miss! Please don't nominate me though, I'm happy to donate either way :)

26/08/2014 18:12:56

Me
Alright, I won't :) Such a mature sense of humour at times, I know. If my mum's been nominated, surely it's just a matter of time though...

26/08/2014 18:14:46

Hayley
Immature humour can be the most hilarious, its all about the timing ! Maybe you're not one of her favourite three people and you'll manage to dodge the bullet? :)

25/09/2014 13:39:05

Me
Hey, how's it going? 
I know it hasn't been all that long, but... I still want to hang out :)
Are you free tomorrow?

25/09/2014 15:48:41

Hayley
Hey :) hanging out sounds cool, but I'm ill at the moment :(. Been off work the past week, so inconvenient! Perhaps once I'm better? How you doing anyway?

25/09/2014 16:31:02

Me
Oh right, hope you feel better! Must be quite bad for a week off :( Let me know when you feel up to it. 
I'm doing well, had this week off, and spent most of it in Stockholm. Been a good break :)

25/09/2014 17:18:25

Hayley
Thanks, yeh either that or I'm just being a drama queen... Aw cool!! How was Stockholm?!

25/09/2014 18:39:50

Me
Well for a week off I'd imagine it's more than a sniffle. Rest up.
Stockholm was beautiful, great food, architecture, and everything is really clean. And well designed. Sometimes it seemed more like the capital city of ikea. I imagine you've just been in bed the last week?

25/09/2014 20:42:02

Hayley
Sounds lovely :). Yeh pretty much, sometimes I switch it up and lie on the couch.. well its been since Tuesday, but not looking likely to be better tomorrow so it's basically a week.

25/09/2014 22:06:28

Me
Hope you feel better soon. Take it easy, Hayley :) Night x

01/10/2014 07:54:40

Me
Hey, how's the plague resistance going?

01/10/2014 11:19:07

Hayley
Hey ! Yeh I'm nearly better thanks :). Back to work but just taking it easy. How're you?

01/10/2014 14:29:45

Me
Grand, glad you're a little less bubonic. Things are all good on my end, busy but fun. Speak soon x

01/10/2014 23:36:27

Me
Hey, know it's kinda late (and a bit short notice) but just worked out I'm free tomorrow night. Feel up to hanging out?

02/10/2014 09:14:07

Hayley
G'morning! Sorry was asleep :). I'm busy tonight sorry! Might have some time on the weekend?

02/10/2014 14:35:56

Me
No worries, and sounds good :) I'll get back to you with a

02/10/2014 14:36:19

Me
* the plan x

02/10/2014 14:42:09

Hayley
Can only really do Saturday evening though, potentially Sunday but waiting to hear back from someone.

02/10/2014 14:55:29

Me
No worries. By the way, I work on a trading floor now, so if they see me on my mobile they might throw me out of a window. Speak later x

02/10/2014 18:36:52

Me
Didn't have to use my jacket as a parachute, so all good. Saturday evening's the only time I could do anyways. Let's meet at Liverpool St for 7 x

02/10/2014 18:52:46

Hayley
Haha good. I've just received intelligence that I've already agreed to going to the pub with friends on Sat night. But you can join us if you like? (Will be in my area though so no worries if you'd rather not!)

02/10/2014 20:03:16

Me
Ha fair enough. Yeah, might have to give that one a miss. We'll figure something out :)

04/10/2014 22:30:41

Hayley
Hey Joe, hows it going ? Was just wondering, you know the other day, what prompted you to get back in touch?

04/10/2014 22:34:41

Me
Hmm? What do you mean?

04/10/2014 22:37:19

Hayley
Dunno, was just wondering... Maybe that's too awks a question, sorry!

04/10/2014 22:39:30

Me
I'm not really sure what you mean? Just ask

04/10/2014 22:40:46

Hayley
I literally just mean what I said: I hadn't heard from you for a while, so what changed that prompted you to get back in touch? :)

04/10/2014 22:45:52

Me
You wanted to take some time. I understood that at face value, and I wanted to respect it, but I just got to the point where I wanted to see you again and didn't want to wait any more.
It sounds kind of like there's something else you thought prompted me, if there is I'd rather just know...

04/10/2014 22:57:35

Hayley
Not at all, I just didn't know so thought it better to ask than just make assumptions. I didn't realise that you were waiting for anything, I kinda came to the conclusion that I probably wouldn't hear from you so it came as a bit of a surprise. A nice one though :)

04/10/2014 22:57:54

Hayley
What did you think I thought prompted you?!

04/10/2014 23:24:43

Me
I had no idea, but it seemed like something was bothering you.
Everything ok?

04/10/2014 23:27:11

Hayley
Everything is fine, nothing bothering me. I was genuinely just wondering cos as I said, it was unexpected.

04/10/2014 23:37:13

Me
Well just as long as it's a nice surprise, I'm good with it. :) I'm used to girls being all about subtext...

04/10/2014 23:48:45

Hayley
Course it's nice to hear from you. Well don't try and read into any subtext here cos it'll just lead to misunderstandings!

05/10/2014 00:00:58

Me
Haha cool :) Night x

07/10/2014 13:57:38

Me
Oh! Just remembered this awesome bar I want to show you. Are you free Thursday? :)

07/10/2014 14:48:02

Hayley
Oh cool. Can't do thurs sorry, v busy this week! Perhaps next week sometime?

07/10/2014 18:12:52

Me
Ah no worries. Maybe next Thursday? I know you're not too bothered about these places, but you'll like this one :)

07/10/2014 21:45:10

Hayley
Lols ok. Yeh Thursday should be fine.x

09/10/2014 21:19:10

Hayley
Hey, just realised I have tickets for the ballet next Thursday so wont be able to meet up. Sorry! Will have to be week after. Hope thats ok :)

09/10/2014 21:25:00

Me
The ballet? Very posh. Have fun :) Call me paranoid, but are we ever going to meet up? X

09/10/2014 21:28:38

Hayley
Hi paranoid!

09/10/2014 21:29:19

Me
What?! Who said that?!!??

09/10/2014 21:29:55

Hayley
Lol! But yeh course we are. Things are just a bit hectic at the moment!

09/10/2014 21:39:11

Me
Alrighty. Kick some ass :) x

10/10/2014 16:38:28

Me
Alright, two options:
Spontaneity; we meet up tonight,
Futurology; we wait (ages) for Monday 20th. Whaddaya reckon? ;)

10/10/2014 17:09:45

Hayley
I have plans tonight, sorry! I also have plans on Monday the 20th lol, and every day in between... Probably sounds like I'm making it up, but I'm honestly not! Told you things were a bit manic!

10/10/2014 17:18:48

Me
Ah you suck. Blow something off :)

10/10/2014 17:20:51

Hayley
I can potentially cancel something on Tuesday 21st?

10/10/2014 17:21:26

Hayley
Otherwise. It'll have to be the thurs or the Fri. Lol I must sound so annoying, sorry!

10/10/2014 17:22:58

Hayley
Also, I don't suck. Don't be mean! ��

10/10/2014 17:41:42

Me
Thursday 23rd. If you find out you've got a surprise out-of-season listing in the Queen's birthday honours, tell her to piss off, you've got plans x

10/10/2014 17:48:34

Me
Also, course not, hyperbole innit

10/10/2014 17:49:57

Hayley
Haha ok!! If you're up for it I can probably meet you late on Monday, around 8ish?

10/10/2014 17:51:04

Me
Which one?

10/10/2014 17:51:21

Hayley
This one.

10/10/2014 17:56:06

Me
Nah, you're alright. Gone off you a bit anyway...

10/10/2014 17:59:16

Me
:) Monday's good

10/10/2014 18:35:51

Hayley
Lol ok, I don't doubt it!

13/10/2014 13:29:05

Me
Hey. Let me know when you're at Liverpool St tonight x

13/10/2014 13:42:16

Hayley
Would you be ok to meet me here? Otherwise we'll just have to meet even later... Don't mind travelling to you though if it suits better, will just have to meet at 8.30.x

13/10/2014 15:53:02

Me
Yeah, no worries. Where's here? X

13/10/2014 15:57:34

Hayley
I'm at uni. So euston/Warren street area. specifically ill be at student central on Malet Street until about 8. Let me know where's best to meet you.x

13/10/2014 19:23:45

Me
Got so wrapped up in work I lost track of the time. Remember the Lucky Pig? :)

13/10/2014 19:27:20

Hayley
I remember it was really loud...

13/10/2014 19:32:00

Me
Didn't have much time to plan. My bar would've been great :P Prefer somewhere else?

13/10/2014 19:40:19

Hayley
Sorry. I don't really mind, just somewhere quiet. We can just meet and find somewhere.

13/10/2014 19:47:27

Me
Sure, I'm at Gt Portland Station, are you still on Malet street?

13/10/2014 19:48:07

Hayley
Yep!

13/10/2014 19:49:34

Me
You'll see my Dustin Hoffman impression

13/10/2014 19:50:30

Hayley
Erm ok...

13/10/2014 19:54:20

Me
Come outside, I'm here

13/10/2014 19:55:19

Hayley
ok.x

13/10/2014 19:58:21

Hayley
I don see you...

13/10/2014 22:56:25

Me
Hey, thanks for meeting up tonight. I don't know about fun per se, awkward maybe, but it was definitely worth doing :) I really hope everything goes well for you, and I owe you a thanks for helping me to figure out some stuff. Take care Hayley :) x

13/10/2014 23:02:14

Me
(Btw, yeah I'm calling it. Time of death - 22.15) :D

13/10/2014 23:04:16

Hayley
No need to thank me. I had a nice time :). That sounds pretty final, like a goodbye...? Also, what are you calling? :/

13/10/2014 23:24:22

Me
I guess sorta. Felt kinda like hoping the dog would come back to life, despite it being apparently still very quiet and not-move-y. So death of that dog, I guess?

13/10/2014 23:34:02

Hayley
Dogs need time for the opportunity to come back to life..! I definately dont think this should be goodbye forever. But I guess I have to respect your decision.

13/10/2014 23:59:10

Me
Hayley, this was me trying to respect your decision. You know I'm still into you, and I understand that things might not be completely clear, but I guess I was expecting Lassie to already be up and barking nonsensically about wells. 
If I had to explain why I thought you maybe didn't enjoy hanging out, I'd probably mention you saying that people seem all the same, including me, not wanting to talk about anything awkward, and that we had been in the pub for less than an hour before you said you wanted to go home.
I don't mean to be bitchy, but it's weird feeling anything at the moment and it's difficult to know what to think

14/10/2014 00:23:24

Hayley
Hmm, I guess those things may have come across like that, and I apologise if they did, but again I think you're looking for subtext where there is none. I have no absolutely no idea what to think or feel either at this point, really it's all very confusing, but I don't think letting the dog just die is the solution.

14/10/2014 00:36:34

Me
I know what you mean, believe me. Let's talk. Not small talk, but actually talk. But not now. Night x

14/10/2014 07:06:29

Hayley
Sorry, fell asleep. Yes I agree, let's!

14/10/2014 08:32:39

Hayley
Though I guess it'll probs have to be sometime next week...?

14/10/2014 08:59:55

Me
Sure x

14/10/2014 14:20:07

Hayley
This stuff keeps playing on my mind, are you free tonight?

14/10/2014 14:24:14

Hayley
No worries if not. I'll get over myself.x

14/10/2014 14:58:55

Me
Narrowly avoided defenestration to reply :) Yeah, I can meet tonight, which part of the world?

14/10/2014 14:59:25

Me
Also, yeah, me too x

14/10/2014 15:04:19

Hayley
Lol, just be discrete! Cool, i can come to you. What time?

14/10/2014 15:57:35

Me
How's Liverpool St station for 7?

14/10/2014 15:58:49

Hayley
Cool. See you then. Let me know if you finish any earlier.

14/10/2014 18:18:21

Me
I can be there for a little after half past? Know it's a bit late notice, sorry

14/10/2014 18:19:03

Hayley
No worries. I'll pack up and head over now.

14/10/2014 18:42:47

Hayley
Be there in 10, where should I meet you?

14/10/2014 18:43:33

Me
You know where the cash machines are? I'm sat near there

14/10/2014 18:48:04

Hayley
In the main station?

14/10/2014 18:48:48

Me
Yup

14/10/2014 18:49:48

Hayley
Yeh, I don't know where they are... I just came out the tube. which way?

14/10/2014 22:54:04

Me
Well that was different. Fun though :) Get back alright?

14/10/2014 22:55:20

Hayley
Yeh was fun, had a nice time :). Yes thanks, had a spot of dinner now getting ready for bed. yourself?

14/10/2014 23:03:35

Me
Had a curry waiting for me. Living at home is *way* too comfortable. Why would I move out and be hungry and cold all the time?

14/10/2014 23:13:45

Hayley
Oh lucky you!! I had to make my own pb&j sandwich!! Haha good question!

14/10/2014 23:17:04

Me
Clearly your parents want you out :p

14/10/2014 23:18:30

Hayley
Lol! I'm not sure they do actually. I've been making my own pb&j 's for many many years now.

14/10/2014 23:19:10

Hayley
And I usually make for them too. so I'm sure they'd prefer me to stay :)

14/10/2014 23:19:55

Me
Must be weird, my parents love me. Jokes. Anyways, tired Joe seems to have a bit of a harsh sense of humour :)

14/10/2014 23:20:34

Me
And with that, I bid thee good night. Night :) x

14/10/2014 23:21:05

Hayley
Lol, niiiiight.xx

15/10/2014 12:59:48

Me
Hey. You were saying yesterday about being kinda sick of London bars. How about this: you plan the next meet-up :)

15/10/2014 13:19:29

Hayley
SKYPE DATE! That way I can be in my pj's! ������

15/10/2014 13:27:27

Hayley
Kidding. Sure I'll plan it :)

15/10/2014 13:29:18

Me
You could come to Chelmsford this weekend with your pjs...

15/10/2014 13:29:57

Hayley
I could if i wasn't in Wales...

15/10/2014 13:32:03

Me
Shucks. Empty house too

15/10/2014 13:33:31

Hayley
Well that's bad timing.

15/10/2014 13:36:29

Me
This is probably the most appropriate time for this emoji...

;)

15/10/2014 13:37:52

Hayley
You shoulda put it after the 'come to Chelmsford with your pjs'

15/10/2014 13:38:37

Me
You're right. I'll remember for next weekend...

15/10/2014 13:40:47

Hayley
Haha. Seeing as the next time we meet up will  be 'date one' (as discussed), we should probably not get ahead of ourselves...!

15/10/2014 13:42:03

Me
As we discussed, I'm an optimist.
Looking forward to hearing the plan :)

15/10/2014 13:44:50

Hayley
The plan will most likely be: Meet somewhere. Get some food.

15/10/2014 13:48:55

Me
Yawn. Good start, but you can do better than that :)

15/10/2014 13:49:22

Hayley
I can. But I'm lazy.

15/10/2014 13:55:10

Me
Dream a little bigger.

15/10/2014 13:56:06

Hayley
Hey, either I'm organising it or I'm not! :P

15/10/2014 13:57:06

Me
I'll get out of the way of your creative process :)

15/10/2014 13:58:18

Hayley
Thanks. But seriously, lower your expectations!

15/10/2014 14:00:07

Me
Lol, I'm just teasing. Chill, yo

15/10/2014 14:01:18

Hayley
I'm perfectly chilled :). I could be in the fridge. Anyway, I gotta get back to work.xx

15/10/2014 14:05:14

Me
Yup, lunch break over x

17/10/2014 13:13:03

Me
Hey poshy, how was the ballet?

17/10/2014 15:01:40

Hayley
Poshy? Moi?! It was really good :). Kept waiting for them to burst into song though...

18/10/2014 22:00:46

Me
Can't say I can really relate, ma'am, being but a poor peasant lad, be'gript only with the moving pictures. Sounds good though.

Can't believe I just typed that. How's Way-Uls?

18/10/2014 22:11:06

Me
Yup, you wait a day and a half and get a strange, Dickensian rambling. Texting's weird.

18/10/2014 22:39:53

Hayley
You drunk or summink? S'alright, lucky for you I'm quite partial to strange dickensian ramblings!

18/10/2014 22:40:41

Hayley
Way-uls is awesome, literally so awesome. we climbed like a whole mountain today to see some castle ruins :).

18/10/2014 23:10:43

Me
Nah, sober blud. Although I can see why you'd ask, Oliver Twist talking about film? Clearly anachronistic.

Sounds awesome. What's on the cards tomorrow? Also, when you say climbed, do you mean Mission Impossible 2 or Lord of the Rings mountain climbing? Big difference :)

18/10/2014 23:40:20

Hayley
Tomorrow we're gonna do some exploring of the town, and there's a food festival on which should be cool!! Ermmm, I don't get either of those references... But there was like a super massive hill and we trekked up it! Hows your Saturday been? :)

19/10/2014 12:22:13

Me
Have fun! Enjoy wales' exotic offerings :)
Just so you know, that's Lord of the Rings mountain climbing. Honestly.
Weekend's been really good, wasn't home alone in the end, so spent it with my brother eating fast food and swapping music. Need one of those every once in a while :) Enjoy the rest of your international adventures x

19/10/2014 20:54:39

Hayley
Ooh sounds cool!! That's what my weekends pretty much always consist of and I love it !! Thankss, will do :)

21/10/2014 22:02:04

Hayley
Heyyyy. Hows things and stuff? :)

21/10/2014 22:05:40

Me
Hey :) been busy but all good dahn my ends. (Did I say that right?) seems like all my relatives are choosing the last few days to pop their clogs. No-one I know, but my parents are pretty bummed out :(
How are you doing? Back from Way-Uls? X

21/10/2014 22:06:39

Me
I think that's an instinctive reaction to 'how are you?'
Great, thanks! Everyone's dead

21/10/2014 22:10:36

Hayley
Aww no! I'm sorry to hear that :(, hope your parents are ok! 
Yeh got back yesterday evening :)

21/10/2014 22:18:45

Me
They're doing well, my Dad just got back from visiting our family up North and my Mum's ok.
How was the rest of the trip?

21/10/2014 22:19:32

Hayley
That's good. Can't be fun :(

21/10/2014 22:20:22

Hayley
The trip was really awesome!!! Apart from a couple of minor annoyances... But yeh. Wales is lovely :)

21/10/2014 22:30:22

Me
It's all good now. No worries.
Cool :) Annoyances? Wha?...
Also, when are you manning up and asking me out on that date?

21/10/2014 22:32:54

Hayley
Yeh, one of our friends just being herself, don't know what else I expected really... 
All in good time my friend, all in good time.

21/10/2014 22:39:14

Me
Ah, every fellowship needs a Smeagol. Or Gollum, depending on how nerdy we're getting. Eh, it's a Lord of the Rings reference, it's all pretty nerdy.
You're going to make me wait longer than the extended cut...

21/10/2014 22:48:26

Hayley
That's only like 9 hours or so right? keep your hair on!

21/10/2014 22:48:49

Hayley
But yeh, what about Saturday?

21/10/2014 23:06:48

Me
Facetious, blud. Potentially. What's the plan?

21/10/2014 23:09:23

Me
That's not an expecting question, btw, just mean where/when

21/10/2014 23:13:14

Hayley
Your face is facetious!! Erm, London, at some point :)

21/10/2014 23:19:11

Me
You're feces-tious (u smell)

21/10/2014 23:22:32

Hayley
That's gross! And also you lose for using 'u' as a word! Unforgivable.

21/10/2014 23:23:15

Me
U r a poobutt

21/10/2014 23:24:53

Hayley
Eugh. I made a mistake, I can't make Saturday anymore! :P

21/10/2014 23:26:42

Me
Too much poobutt business to attend to. I understand. I have cool people stuff so it's all good

21/10/2014 23:29:02

Me
Jeez it's like primary school again. This is what happens when you have business meetings all day, you have to swing back the other way

21/10/2014 23:29:46

Hayley
Ah right. Oh, I didn't know you swing both ways! Good for you :)

21/10/2014 23:35:51

Me
Yeah, normally like girls :)

21/10/2014 23:37:32

Hayley
Good to know :)

21/10/2014 23:38:55

Me
But now I like a lady :) 
(Would've been nice, but has a tinge too much of an age distinction...)

21/10/2014 23:39:41

Me
Anyways, poobutt, I'm going to bed. Night x

21/10/2014 23:40:11

Hayley
Lool, nighty night.xx

22/10/2014 08:14:11

Me
Can't believe I called you a poobutt last night. Wtf

22/10/2014 09:00:15

Hayley
Multiple times...!

22/10/2014 09:52:06

Me
Can't be mature all the time. Plus you kinda asked for it. Your face is facetious?

22/10/2014 10:48:41

Hayley
Dont worry, I found it hilarious! And yeh, you were being patronising so I had to insult you :).

23/10/2014 21:46:17

Me
Hey. When are we meeting on Saturday? :)

23/10/2014 21:56:50

Hayley
No idea. Some time in the afternoon I guess. I'll do some figuring out. :)

23/10/2014 21:59:29

Hayley
What time would suit?

23/10/2014 22:07:15

Me
Can't ask that, I'd be organising it :)

23/10/2014 22:07:49

Hayley
Ok let me re-phrase. When will you be available?

23/10/2014 22:09:34

Me
From some time in the afternoon x

23/10/2014 22:10:20

Hayley
Alrighty, we'll me at that time then!

23/10/2014 22:13:00

Me
:) I'm free from about 2.

23/10/2014 22:14:11

Me
Just wondering if you had anything in mind, is all. No worries if you'd rather not figure it out...

23/10/2014 22:15:32

Hayley
Alrightyyy, was gonna suggest meeting at about 4? I have something in mind, but it's by no means an entire plan. More: let's roll up to this place, check out this one thing and then see what else we find.

23/10/2014 22:22:51

Me
I have no idea what I'm describing, but sounds good. Feels kinda like texting about a drug deal though :)

23/10/2014 22:23:54

Me
Anyways, how's it going?

23/10/2014 22:35:37

Hayley
Lol!! Yeh, not a drug deal, as far as I know! It's going okkk. day was a bit shit, but evenings been good enough. Did a bit of cooking for tomorrows dinner and saw a whole bunch of fireworks displays when I went for a run, which was cooool :). How're you?? 
Btw I was wondering, I know you dislike the medium of text messaging, but what's your opinion on using the phone for its original intended purpose??

23/10/2014 22:51:55

Me
Glad it seems to have gotten steadily better :) 
I'm doing pretty well, had a surprise visit from my brother just for tonight. Been a good laugh. 
I've got no problem with voice calls, almost forgot these things can do that...

23/10/2014 22:53:15

Hayley
Coool :). Haha yeh they do! Impressive eh? Cool, we should try it some time :)

23/10/2014 22:58:51

Me
Sounds good :) Can't tomorrow, but we should. Night Hayley x

23/10/2014 22:59:17

Hayley
Alrighty! Niight.xx

25/10/2014 12:08:47

Hayley
Did you say your train into London stops in Stratford?

25/10/2014 12:10:16

Me
It does, yeah. Are we meeting there? X

25/10/2014 12:48:13

Hayley
Ermmmm, no. Plan is to go and mooch around greenwhich market, and I think you can get the dlr straight from Stratford so that might make your life easier? (Was originally gonna suggest meeting at tower gateway but line closures)

25/10/2014 12:49:07

Hayley
So meet at Cutty Sark around 4 ish?

25/10/2014 13:25:26

Me
Sounds fun, thanks for figuring out my journey! See you then x

25/10/2014 15:26:05

Me
Be there at about 10 past :)

25/10/2014 15:47:42

Hayley
Ok, see you then :)

25/10/2014 16:12:19

Me
Had to switch trains, there soon!

25/10/2014 23:37:58

Me
Are you still here?

25/10/2014 23:39:15

Hayley
Just going down to the tube... Whatsup?

25/10/2014 23:39:43

Me
Have you passed the barrier?

25/10/2014 23:40:00

Hayley
Not quite

25/10/2014 23:40:35

Hayley
What's wrong??

25/10/2014 23:41:46

Me
Hang on, which line?

25/10/2014 23:42:35

Hayley
Jubilee line. Should I not go through?

25/10/2014 23:42:53

Me
Yeah, don't

25/10/2014 23:44:57

Hayley
You're so cute :). Thanks for the kiss :)

25/10/2014 23:49:24

Me
My pleasure :) Thanks for organising tonight x

26/10/2014 00:16:44

Hayley
You're welcome :), if you can call that organising...!

26/10/2014 00:23:03

Me
Well, the journey part anyway :)

26/10/2014 00:25:28

Hayley
Yeh... Kinda dropped the ball there too, just realised it woulda been much faster for you to get the tube to Stratford, it's only 4 stops! But ah well.

26/10/2014 00:27:15

Me
Yeah, twigged when the dlr door closed. Got the last train though :) Let me know when you get home x

26/10/2014 00:27:57

Hayley
Niiice, will do.x

26/10/2014 00:45:43

Hayley
Home :). Let me know when you're back safe x

26/10/2014 01:29:05

Me
Delayed, but home. Really enjoyed this, looking forward to #2 x

26/10/2014 01:29:42

Me
Night x

26/10/2014 01:30:03

Hayley
Same :). Nighty Night.xx

28/10/2014 18:24:43

Me
Hey. I wanna see you. How's Saturday? X

28/10/2014 18:35:17

Hayley
I might be going down to Bournemouth on Saturday. Can do Friday though?

28/10/2014 18:38:30

Me
Friday's good, I'll figure it out and let you know what the plan is x

28/10/2014 18:41:50

Hayley
Coolio :). Don't worry too much about a plan tho, as long as we get to hang out :)

28/10/2014 19:18:28

Me
Sweet. I like that :)

28/10/2014 21:35:48

Hayley
Hows the gig?

28/10/2014 23:28:28

Me
It was awesome. Great crowd, and they played all their best stuff. Looking forward to seeing you x

28/10/2014 23:29:59

Me
How was your night?

28/10/2014 23:34:58

Hayley
Sounds awesome :). Me too ;). 
Was good thanks, went bowling, didn't play very well :( but was good fun !

30/10/2014 18:43:34

Me
Just realised tomorrow's Halloween! If only we were still 12. Meet at Liverpool St for 7? X

30/10/2014 18:49:48

Hayley
Lol. See you then.

30/10/2014 19:45:41

Me
Everything alright? :)

30/10/2014 19:51:53

Hayley
Yep :). Everything alright with you?

30/10/2014 20:14:56

Me
Surviving :) Lots going on, been really busy. How's today been?

30/10/2014 20:21:35

Hayley
Sounds cool :), you can tell me all about it tomorrow. Today's been pretty lame. Tomorrow should be better :).

30/10/2014 20:23:33

Me
Cool beans. Looking forward to it :)

31/10/2014 18:45:32

Hayley
Where should I meet you?

31/10/2014 18:46:18

Me
... Cash machines? ;)

31/10/2014 18:48:29

Hayley
Still don't know where they are...

31/10/2014 18:49:26

Me
Are you here? How about under the middle departure board thingy?

31/10/2014 18:53:03

Me
On the walkway x

01/11/2014 00:47:45

Me
This has been such a rough-ass week. Thanks for making the end a lot better :) Bit of a shame I'll get my train. To be honest though, would much rather a weekend or start-to-midweek date next time, I'm normally so zombified on Fridays. Speaking of which, loads of zombies around now... Watch out x

01/11/2014 00:44:58

Hayley
You get in your train ok?

01/11/2014 00:50:22

Hayley
No need to thank me, it was pretty awesome :). Sure whatever suits! Haha, I'm literally sitting right next to one...!!

01/11/2014 00:55:34

Me
Missed it by 1min

01/11/2014 00:56:10

Hayley
No way???!! Actually??!

01/11/2014 00:56:29

Me
For real

01/11/2014 00:57:30

Me
Getting one to Billericay instead. Day-um

01/11/2014 00:59:21

Hayley
Fuuuuuudge! I'm sorry!! How long till that train?

01/11/2014 01:01:40

Me
On it now. Don't be sorry! I was kinda expecting this anyways :) I'll trade getting in a bit later for a make-out any day

01/11/2014 01:04:43

Hayley
Hehe it sure was fun :). But seriously, stop knowingly missing your trains!! :P

01/11/2014 01:07:59

Me
One time! :)

01/11/2014 01:08:43

Hayley
Well two technically!

01/11/2014 01:12:18

Me
Damn this zombie brain! When was the other one?

01/11/2014 01:16:09

Hayley
Just now! Lol don't worry. I'm just home, please let me know if / when you ever get there!

01/11/2014 01:19:19

Me
I'll be fine, I've got an oat bar if things really get bad. Will do x

01/11/2014 02:07:08

Me
Just got in, hope you're reading this in the morning! If not, Night :)

01/11/2014 08:59:40

Hayley
Yeh, didn't quite manage to stay up! Glad you got home safe eventually!xx

01/11/2014 10:53:06

Me
Wasn't that late in the end, no worries :) That was a pretty cool night really, feel all growed up now. And that restaurant was totally a posh one! All ok getting up this morning?

01/11/2014 11:40:33

Hayley
2am's not that late?? Haha yeh we're like such adults now :). Yep, wasn't too painful. coulda done with another couple hours sleep though...

01/11/2014 11:41:50

Hayley
You cracking on with work now then?

01/11/2014 12:19:38

Me
Yeah I slept in til half 10, ner ner :) On it now. Going quite quickly at the moment, hopefully I'm not doing it completely wrong. How's Bournemouth? X

01/11/2014 15:29:49

Hayley
Lol good for you :). That's good! I'm sure you're not! Bmufs cool, had lunch with the gparents, then saw our aunty for a little bit, she brought me Harry potter jelly beans from the theme park in Florida Wooo!

01/11/2014 15:39:17

Hayley
Also, check the picture I sent on whatsapp, the lunch table was laid with those today!

01/11/2014 16:05:49

Me
Holy crap! No wonder you thought the restaurant yesterday was no biggie, you really are poshy! Not just a name on a plate either, but one-time-use-only napkins with expert calligraphy? Jeez.
How's everyone doing? X

01/11/2014 16:38:05

Hayley
Hahaa!! Well there's also the matchboxes and the letter heads! But it's not cos we're posh, my gdad used to have a catering business called Oberlander, so the napkins are leftover from that :). That also probably explains the laying the table properly etc too!

01/11/2014 16:39:00

Hayley
Everyone's doing ok thanks, as expected I guess.x

01/11/2014 17:43:24

Me
Nah, I reckon you're secretly a millionaire heiress. Still though, Oberlander is a cool name, and totally works as a catering company. Think I might have less success...
Glad everyone's alright :) I know it kinda sucks, but your visit will mean a lot. Are you back now? X

01/11/2014 18:20:35

Hayley
Haha not quite! Looool yeh, people might the wrong idea about what kinds business you're running.... 
Yeh they seemed to really appreciate it so totally worth it, I actually really enjoyed it, felt so weird to be there without the parents though, but good weird :). Just making our way around the M25 atm, should be home within 20mins or so!

01/11/2014 18:20:43

Hayley
Hows your day going?

01/11/2014 19:08:27

Me
Good weird. Really are growing up :) I'm sure they did. Today's been alright, but it's amazing how much more interesting and important every else is other than what you're supposed to be doing. So I spent an hour swapping mini bagel recipes with my mum (cream cheese, avocado and tomato won, btw) Back on track now, ish :D

01/11/2014 19:50:47

Hayley
Haha I totally understand! That's been my life all week! Do the recipes work with normal sized bagels too? Or is it just the mini ones? :P. You planning on working quite late then?

01/11/2014 20:02:04

Me
Yeah, I'm sure I'd get a lot done, just not what needs doing. There's something about the mini ones, it's weird. But the proper ones need to be slathered in peanut butter. There's rules. 
Probably :) Procrastinating at the gym right now. I say that, I actually did get a lot done today, so no worries. Might call abt 9 if you're up for it? X

01/11/2014 21:15:12

Hayley
Sorryyy didn't see your call. Just eating dinner, call you back in a bit?

01/11/2014 21:27:06

Me
Yeah, no worries :)

02/11/2014 10:54:17

Hayley
Mooorning! So I had a very weird dream last night... I was working at a shopping centre or something and loads of the other girls who worked there kept coming up to me and hitting on me... It was like they knew something I didn't haha!!

02/11/2014 11:09:33

Me
You're right, that really is weird. Please don't subconsciously be a lesbian, that would suck. And erm, lick. I guess. Anyways, getting sidetracked. My point is, they can't have ya. I've called dibs and everything x

02/11/2014 11:13:03

Hayley
Ewwww!! That's gross. And I literally shouted 'eww' upon reading that - probs means I'm not a lesbian so don't worry.
And you've called dibs eh?? Lol.x

02/11/2014 11:22:50

Me
That's reassuring! Yeah, calling dibs in a completely post-feminist, yes-a-woman-could-totally-be-president kind of way. Sounds a bit less creepy than "She's MINE". Although that is sorta the message. Hmm. Sounding more 1950s than I'd intended here...

02/11/2014 11:25:49

Me
The female president thing is still quite funny, btw :)

02/11/2014 11:49:52

Hayley
Loool! You're funny :). Hah, I can't really be held accountable for the bullshit I spew when tipsy on wine. probably best to just forget about the whole conversation!

02/11/2014 13:19:04

Me
Nah, I'm holding on to this one for a while. I'll bring it up from time to time, because I'll probably need to trade it's retirement for something I say. At Sunday dinner just now, are you?

02/11/2014 13:50:30

Hayley
That's fair enough! I really don't feel bad or embarrassed about what I said though, but if you wanna keep bringing it up then go right ahead :). 
Erm, If you can count sitting on the couch on my own, eating pasta and watching strictly being at sunday dinner, then yes I am :)

02/11/2014 15:11:18

Me
I'm only teasing, though I do like that you don't really care about it :)
That actually sounds like quite a good one. I guess Catholics love a Sunday roast. See what I meant about Scott Mills? And the Eastenders guy was good. 
Unfortunately, my gran just got quite ill so we're planning out how to get her into hospital now. She'll be alright. Why does all this stuff happen at the same time?

02/11/2014 15:21:27

Hayley
Oh shit, is she ok? I'm sorry to hear that :(

02/11/2014 15:55:35

Me
Just getting old, I guess. Apparently it's not always awesome, but still, better than the alternative. Hopefully just a short stay in until she's a bit better. Thanks for asking though.
Hey speaking of Strictly, ever been much of a dancer yourself? :)

02/11/2014 16:38:11

Hayley
No, unfortunately it's not :(.
Ummm.. not really, although I do enjoy a good dance after a few drinks ! Yourself?

02/11/2014 17:59:06

Me
Never really tried, it's much easier to stand at the bar and shout-chat with friends and not actually give it a go. It'd be cool to learn how to do it properly one day. 
Just had a visit from my Craig uncle, Craig, who I am sure I have mentioned by his real name, Craig, at some point. He's still Craig'in it up, btw.
Hows the rest of your Sunday going?

02/11/2014 18:13:48

Hayley
Tut tut that's no good. Dancing like a teat and not giving a shit what you look like is one of the funniest things ever! Ah right yeh, his name is Craig right? Or Chris? I can never remember... Haha. but thats cool. Pretty goood, i was going to do some work but my mum insisted I sat and watched miracle on 34th street, no regrets! And now am doing some coooking.x

02/11/2014 18:52:52

Me
Haha! You've sold me. Definitely got to give it a try sometime. 
It's November 2nd! Perfect time to start building hype :) Great movie though, love and totally buy Attenborough as Santa. Tim Allen is great and all, but one actor can't be both Father Christmas AND Buzz Lightyear. It's just a bit wrong. X

02/11/2014 19:36:51

Me
Hey what was the name of the fireworks display you mentioned?

02/11/2014 19:39:52

Hayley
Haha I quite agree! 
Fireworks: http://www.southwark.gov.uk/southwarkpresents/fireworks
Show starts at 7 :)

02/11/2014 20:21:26

Me
Looks awesome :) Meet at Canada Water at 6.20? X

02/11/2014 20:25:04

Hayley
Sure thanggg x

03/11/2014 08:36:14

Me
Morning. Please tell me no more lesbian retail dreams?? Might start being concerned... :)

03/11/2014 08:49:28

Hayley
Mooorning! Nope, not last night. In fact you may have made an appearance :). Dont remember what happened though.x

03/11/2014 08:54:19

Me
Ooh. Are you saying I'm dreamy? Yeah, I know :)

03/11/2014 08:58:21

Hayley
Haha! Your words, not mine :)

03/11/2014 18:03:34

Me
Oof. Ouch. Well so long as I didn't have three heads or something, all's good :) Get much procrastinating done today? X

03/11/2014 18:20:49

Hayley
Hah, you may have done, can't remem. Hey, I resent that question! But yes I did thank you. I also got plenty of good work done but lets not worry about that as much! :P

03/11/2014 19:06:59

Me
I choose to believe it was a  sex dream. Even though I'm pretty sure it wasn't. That's good! Means you can stay out later Wednesday :)

03/11/2014 19:28:59

Hayley
Hahah cheeky!! Yeh it does :).

03/11/2014 19:32:22

Hayley
Watching Harry potter one at Harry potter soc :) aren't I a cool?!

03/11/2014 19:44:37

Me
Ha cool. Enjoy :) x

03/11/2014 19:47:25

Hayley
Thanks it's pretty hilarious, we're all sitting here quoting the whole thing like losers. Anyway, Hows your project going and stuff?x

03/11/2014 20:16:24

Me
That sounds absolutely surreal. Ironically, a room full of people chanting the words to Harry potter seems more like witchcraft than the film itself. I really like that though :) Project's going really well, thanks. I feel substantially better about all of that. And my Gran's home again! Today's coming up Milhouse x

03/11/2014 20:33:42

Hayley
Haha! It's nice to know that I'm not alone in my looserishness. That was gonna be my next question, very glad to hear she's home :)

03/11/2014 21:24:54

Me
Life's much more fun with a bit of that. Yeah, we're all really relieved :) She's feeling much more positive now, too. Looking forward to some fireworks :)

03/11/2014 21:36:22

Hayley
That's great :), glad to hear it!
Yehh me too! Been thinking about your insistence that my dream was of a sexy type... Gonna see what I can do about that for tonights one ;)

03/11/2014 21:45:46

Me
Looking for round 2? I could totally help with that.

03/11/2014 21:49:08

Me
I'll be honest, I'm a bit jealous of dream Joe right now

03/11/2014 21:55:07

Hayley
You could help with that? How so? Hehe, nothing to be jealous of as of yet!!

03/11/2014 22:11:57

Me
Um, I'm sure we could think of something :) Apparently. I'd like to make dream Joe a bit jealous too.

03/11/2014 22:22:27

Hayley
Hehe ��

03/11/2014 22:30:17

Hayley
Omg I've just realised how late at night it is wtf! Why am I stuck on a train and not tucked up in bed?!

03/11/2014 22:38:13

Me
You've been on a train this whole time? Still getting back from HP soc?

03/11/2014 22:39:07

Hayley
Not the whooole time, but the last 20 mins or so. Just walking home now.x

03/11/2014 22:45:43

Me
Haha thought you were in bed, tbh. Get wrapped up! These crazy HP fans... :D

03/11/2014 22:51:31

Hayley
Lool, I can multitask ;). But should be in bed in the next 15 mins yeeey :)

03/11/2014 23:06:51

Me
Haha awesome. Night Hayley (sweet dreams ;)

03/11/2014 23:07:23

Hayley
Same to you .xx

04/11/2014 13:01:46

Me
Hey hey. I'd be amazed if you were able to conjure up a dream on demand :) How's it going? X

04/11/2014 13:37:12

Hayley
I can sometimes... But not always unfortunately. Pretty good thanks! I'm cold though, might put the heating on. How interesting. How are you?x

04/11/2014 18:23:58

Me
Doing well, just work work work. Looking forward to a good weekend off :) Blankets and movies are definitely in order. I'm sure you got up to some other non central heating related adventures today? X

04/11/2014 18:53:05

Hayley
I sure did, did a bit of stressing about whether  to stay at home and work late or go to bowling... Decided on the latter, although it's raining which is hindersome.

04/11/2014 19:18:33

Me
Life's about balance. Can't work all the time. Enjoy it!

04/11/2014 19:42:41

Me
Go all Spartan on it. Cos 300... I'll let myself out.

04/11/2014 22:01:47

Hayley
Lool! Got halfway there, 151, not tooo bad I guess. But now I'm sad cos I dropped my new scarf running for the train, went back to look for it but someone had stolen it and now I've missed my train... :(

04/11/2014 22:02:28

Hayley
I hate everyone and everything ����

04/11/2014 22:07:34

Me
Nooooo! Thieves. I'll get you a Dr Who scarf (no chance of accidental loss, plus it might get you watching the new ones) :) How long til the next train? And you can't hate *everything and everyone*

04/11/2014 22:09:50

Hayley
I can and I do.

04/11/2014 22:10:05

Me
What about foals and chicks? Do you hate foals, Hayley? WHAT DID THEY DO

04/11/2014 22:14:20

Hayley
I'm being unreasonable, and I'm allowed to because some twat stole my scarf.

04/11/2014 22:24:40

Me
I completely understand. However, there is a solemn boyfriend duty to respond to twattish incidents like you've just suffered with bad humour in an attempt to cheer you up. 
There's a big manual. Takes ages to read. 
For the realz though, Tom Baker knew his scarves...

04/11/2014 22:29:04

Me
Twats gon be twats.

04/11/2014 22:29:21

Hayley
Yeh but don't shout at me :(

04/11/2014 22:32:04

Hayley
I appreciated the terrible, awful humour though thanks!

04/11/2014 22:35:19

Me
I know it sucks. You ok? :)

04/11/2014 22:41:27

Hayley
I'll be fine dw x

04/11/2014 22:49:16

Me
Are you home?

04/11/2014 22:49:46

Hayley
Yeh, just got in :)

04/11/2014 22:51:41

Me
You wanna talk about it? :)

04/11/2014 22:53:01

Hayley
It's ok, it's already quite late and I need to get ready for bet etc still. Thanks though x

04/11/2014 22:54:47

Me
Glad you're ok :) Looking forward to tomorrow night. Night x

05/11/2014 18:07:43

Me
Here a little early. It's rammed! I'm outside the Lower Road exit x

05/11/2014 18:14:07

Me
If you do a u-turn to the right once you come out, you should see me

05/11/2014 18:33:31

Hayley
Sorry. Just coming up now!

05/11/2014 23:33:23

Me
Yeah, I like kissing you too.

05/11/2014 23:33:49

Hayley
Hehe, was just thinking the same :)

05/11/2014 23:38:20

Me
New date idea- a bench

05/11/2014 23:39:12

Hayley
Or a sofa? Much more comfortable, plus inside :)

05/11/2014 23:40:26

Me
If only one of us had a house we could use this Saturday... :)

05/11/2014 23:41:30

Hayley
A whole house??

05/11/2014 23:43:27

Me
Yup. A whole, empty house. Until midnight x

05/11/2014 23:47:28

Me
I'm talking about making out, btw. #justsaying

05/11/2014 23:45:05

Hayley
Oooh, well that cha yes things.

05/11/2014 23:49:06

Hayley
Hehe I know dw. Sounds awesome :)

05/11/2014 23:52:36

Me
Sweet :)

05/11/2014 23:59:17

Hayley
I'm home :), let me know when you get in.x

05/11/2014 23:59:53

Me
Will do. Thanks for letting me know x

06/11/2014 00:27:49

Me
Home and in bed :) Really enjoyed watching fireworks with you. Night Hayley x

06/11/2014 00:28:51

Hayley
Same :). Night night xxx

06/11/2014 20:50:55

Hayley
Good evening JoeBert :)

06/11/2014 20:51:22

Me
Sup Haze :)

06/11/2014 20:52:11

Hayley
Hows it going? :)

06/11/2014 21:00:17

Me
Pretty good, thanks. No updates about the job sitch, but a fun day nonetheless. Wasn't really worth thinking too much about :) How was yours?

06/11/2014 21:31:28

Hayley
No news is good news :). Yeh all good, pretty normal overall :)

06/11/2014 21:54:51

Me
Grand. Looking forward to Saturday :) Think you'll be driving? X

06/11/2014 21:59:57

Hayley
Yeeeh, me too :). Yeh I'm thinking I'll probably drive... Think it'll just be easier... But you said train is a better idea?

06/11/2014 22:19:15

Me
Nah, you're right, it'll probably be faster and easier. My address is 10 Kingston Avenue, Chelmsford CM2 6DP, say 4pm? How are you with dogs? :)

06/11/2014 22:44:04

Hayley
Ooh how exciting :). Four's good, but maybe a bit earlier if you can? Make the most of the day :) and dogs... I can take them or leave them...

06/11/2014 23:12:38

Me
Sounds good :) How's 2? You'll probably like Ash. Just to pre-warn you now, at some point I may or may not attempt to put Indiana Jones on :D

06/11/2014 23:14:45

Hayley
Ok lets go with 2, and I'll try to be on time :). Haha, that's ok, ill just distract you with other matters if you try and make me watch it ;)

06/11/2014 23:21:37

Me
;)

06/11/2014 23:22:40

Me
Yeah, well I'm definitely putting it on now. Night Haze :) x

06/11/2014 23:32:34

Hayley
Hehe. Sleep good JoeBert.x

07/11/2014 11:32:25

Hayley
So I just saw a man walking down the street wearing only swimming shorts...

07/11/2014 11:32:34

Hayley
And shoes

07/11/2014 11:32:39

Hayley
But that was it!

07/11/2014 12:37:32

Me
And in November! He's brave. ...but why? Maybe a stag do?

07/11/2014 12:44:26

Hayley
Not sure it was through choice, I think possibly he didn't actually have any other clothes... Who knows.

07/11/2014 18:25:22

Me
So bizarre. I think I've mentioned, but in Brighton you'd see guys grocery shopping with a lumberjack beard, lipstick, miniskirt and high heels. Not sure this is the same type of thing though... Maybe he just really likes Speedos?

07/11/2014 19:21:18

Hayley
Hahah that's hilarious! Makes a trip to the shops a little more interesting I guess!! Hows you're Friday evening going? :)

07/11/2014 20:03:37

Me
Been short, only got in about a half hour ago. Definitely ready for the weekend :) Having dinner with mom and pop now. How's yours? X

07/11/2014 20:18:41

Me
And trying to convince my dog that the world isn't ending :) / :(

07/11/2014 20:28:20

Hayley
Worked late eh? I took the afternoon off hehe :). Sounds good! Just had dinner with friends now going home for tea :). Whyds he think the worlds ending??? Poor doggy.

07/11/2014 21:05:52

Me
Yup, but so that I could solve a problem I'd be working on all week. Feels soooo good. Cor, some people have it good, don't they? :) gotta work through that thousand bags. I don't think Ash understands the concept of fireworks night, he must think we're all just very chilled about Armageddon :)

07/11/2014 21:22:37

Hayley
Oooh that's cool!! Well done :):). Haha yh, but i reckoned I earned it! Omggg I have such a sore throat :(, hope I'm not getting ill!

07/11/2014 21:37:28

Me
I know you will have :) Get to bed! An early night helps a lot. Thought I might earlier in the week, but sleep sorted it :)

07/11/2014 21:39:28

Hayley
Yeh I'll go bed soon, just waiting for my friends to head home.x

07/11/2014 22:08:42

Hayley
They're finally gone, I love them but boi do I want to go to bed!

07/11/2014 22:22:06

Me
Sorry, was with my dad. Do! Don't worry if you're a bit hoarse tomorrow. Hope you feel ok :)

07/11/2014 22:24:56

Hayley
No worries :). Lol I probably will be unless I manage to sleep it off! I feel pretty ok though, snuggled up in bed with a hot honey and lemon :)

07/11/2014 22:27:12

Me
That's good :) get better! Night Haze xx

07/11/2014 22:28:08

Hayley
Cheers joebert, night.xx

08/11/2014 10:04:23

Me
Hey, how are you feeling? (Please say you're still coming today... :) ) x

08/11/2014 10:37:41

Hayley
Mooorning. Not sure yet, will assess the situation once I'm vertical. I'd imagine it's fine though :)

08/11/2014 10:53:43

Hayley
Feel pretty much fine, just a sore throat! :)

08/11/2014 10:59:01

Me
Sweet! Big relief haha :) Really glad you're ok. Sorry about the throat x

08/11/2014 11:01:52

Me
Really looking forward to seeing you :)

08/11/2014 11:02:36

Hayley
Same,same and saaammmeee x

08/11/2014 11:12:57

Hayley
Also, I woke up a lot later than anticipated so might get there a bit later, but will let you know. hope thats ok.x

08/11/2014 11:21:45

Me
No worries, whenever you get here's cool :)

08/11/2014 13:30:04

Hayley
Will probs be there closer to three. leaving in a bit!

08/11/2014 13:40:55

Me
See you then :)

08/11/2014 14:08:09

Hayley
Where should I park btw?

08/11/2014 14:10:58

Me
I've got a big drive, no worries x

08/11/2014 14:55:40

Hayley
I need a pee soooo bad. nearly there!

08/11/2014 14:58:46

Me
Haha :)

08/11/2014 15:02:21

Hayley
And this traffic is NOT helping!

08/11/2014 22:42:27

Me
Tonight was a lot of fun :) glad you finally got to see Chelmsford. Let me know when you get home xx

08/11/2014 23:33:54

Hayley
Just got back :). It was more that a lot of fun! Can't wait to see you again.xx

08/11/2014 23:50:35

Me
I can't wait either. Going to be thinking about this quite a bit. :)

08/11/2014 23:51:33

Hayley
'This' being? :)

08/11/2014 23:52:20

Me
The Michael Flatley documentary

08/11/2014 23:52:27

Me
;)

08/11/2014 23:57:21

Me
I think we both know what 'this' means :D

09/11/2014 00:05:06

Hayley
Hehe, see cos I was thinking about Michael flatley too, didn't think you were that into it...

09/11/2014 00:17:56

Me
Haha :) Thankfully we found something much more interesting to do x

09/11/2014 00:18:49

Me
Goodnight Haze ;) x

09/11/2014 00:19:09

Hayley
Yeep ;). Niiiiight xxxx

09/11/2014 11:20:20

Hayley
Mooorning joebert ��

09/11/2014 11:27:31

Me
Morning :) How're you feeling today? X

09/11/2014 11:34:14

Hayley
Bloody knackered, could barely pull myself out of bed! But otherwise pretty happy :) (except the sore throat). How about you?x

09/11/2014 12:47:25

Me
Hope the throat gets better soon :) I'm doing well, with the family at my Grandparents. Thinking about you a lot x

09/11/2014 13:31:13

Hayley
Same here ��. Hows your gran doing?

09/11/2014 14:03:26

Me
She's not well, but in good spirits :) glad she's home. Thanks for asking :) How's your Sunday going? X

09/11/2014 14:55:45

Hayley
Oh I'm sorry to hear that, but good spirits is good :). It's goood, watched strictly, now hanging with Sophage :) you?

09/11/2014 16:31:56

Me
Sounds good :) Very busy, seems like I've been taxi driver today. Just dropped Jonny at work. Good lad. 
Honestly, been a bit hard to concentrate today. Seem to keep thinking about other things... ;)

09/11/2014 17:36:21

Hayley
Sounds good, we all have those taxi driver days, all part of the living at home experience.

09/11/2014 17:38:09

Hayley
Hehe, Me too. Have a flash back and then think, was that a dream or did that actually happen?!

09/11/2014 17:39:16

Hayley
Oh gosh, seems like my grandmas back in hospital, it's like some morbid relay race :(

09/11/2014 18:00:15

Me
I know the feeling :) Glad it did, though. The next time can't come soon enough.

I'm really sorry to hear that :( I hope she's ok. Do you know what's going on?

09/11/2014 18:16:50

Hayley
Haven't been given that much info, something to do with her breathing... Hopefully it'll be ok.x

09/11/2014 18:46:48

Me
Fingers crossed. Why do all these things happen at the same time? :(

09/11/2014 18:49:13

Me
I was thinking about when we could meet up again. Would you be up for going to the Tower of London/ St Katherine's Docks on Wednesday? X

09/11/2014 18:56:44

Hayley
I guess thats just how life works unfortunately... Yep wed sounds good :) I'm working in town that day too so works out well :). Looking forward to seeing youuuu :):)xx

09/11/2014 19:30:17

Me
Sweet :) Tell me about it. Doing some work and listening to that album again now ;)

09/11/2014 20:02:30

Hayley
Sounds like a productive way to work! Hehe. What work you doing anyway?

09/11/2014 20:17:28

Me
Yeah, perhaps not the best way to focus :) Still going with the project. It's not so bad, actually beginning to enjoy it. How's the throat doing? Can I ask a bit of a strange question? Did I, um... leave any marks?

09/11/2014 20:23:32

Hayley
Ah right, how comes you're carrying on with it? Just for funsies ? Throats ok, did you manage to avoid catching anything then? Hehe yeh you did actually, bit of a bruise on my neck and my inner thighs are a bit worse for wear... not complaining though ;). But why'd you ask? :)

09/11/2014 20:57:52

Me
It's more of a rolling thing, I'll be working on it for a long time yet. Plus, if another placement is on the cards, it'll be a big help.
Didn't catch anything, somehow :) I remember you saying you bruised easily and was a bit worried. Glad it wasn't too bad x

09/11/2014 21:09:14

Hayley
Ah right. Good on ya for working on it at the weekend then :). Oh riight, I thought you were trying to find out whether you'd successfully 'made your mark' ��

09/11/2014 21:49:09

Me
It's not so bad. Still, not the most fun I've had this weekend. I was genuinely concerned, but now that you've said it, it does feel oddly good :)

09/11/2014 22:10:05

Hayley
Appreciate the concern but no need, I quite like it too ��

09/11/2014 22:27:04

Me
Ooh. I like that. How's the rest of your Sunday been? X

09/11/2014 22:34:17

Hayley
It's been a strange one, was with Sophage cooking dinner, then got a call to come home cos shit was going down at the hospital, but then actually there wasn't quite as much to worry about. Now just chilling watching a movie with sis, so all in all not all that bad a day really. Yours? You off to bed soon?x

09/11/2014 22:51:54

Me
Oh right. That does sound odd. Hope everything's ok now :) Mine's been alright, watched a bit of Strictly with my mum. Think I have to admit it now, I do quite like it.
Probably in another half hour or so. You? X

09/11/2014 22:54:33

Hayley
Ohh who got knocked out? I forgot to watch the rest of the results show! Same, gonna climb into bed soon but stay up a wee bit longer probably.x

09/11/2014 23:11:55

Me
Alison. Can't believe I just gave you Strictly results haha. Off to bed myself now. Night Haze :) xx

09/11/2014 23:12:51

Hayley
Ahh noo, I liked her :(. Eh well. Night joebert, sleep wellll.xxxx

10/11/2014 13:23:11

Me
Looking forward to Wednesday :) x

10/11/2014 13:31:17

Hayley
Wish Wednesday came straight after Monday..x

10/11/2014 18:02:16

Me
I know the feeling. Boring meetings aren't quite so boring when you let your mind wander a bit... ;) How's your day been? X

10/11/2014 18:19:44

Hayley
Hehe! Days been ok, gonna work a little bit more tho I think, took me a while to get going this morning... X

10/11/2014 19:08:21

Me
Good on you :) Could do with some of your motivation. Just got in, should really start on the project. My friend Sam invited me to a wine tasting he's hosting. Thought that stuff was meant to kick in after we turn 30? X

10/11/2014 20:27:27

Hayley
Not sure some of my motivation would be any use at all, think I only did another 30 mins or so haha. I'm confused as to the nature of this project, so it's an extra thing you're doing on top of work? Not your actual work that you've been doing all day?
Ooh, who's the poshy now? Wine tasting eh? Lol, but sounds fun! Didn't you say Sam's matured faster than a normal human anyway with having kids and that.x

10/11/2014 21:22:35

Me
The project started out as a masochistic tool my boss would use to assess junior staff and instil end-of-placement dread. (Some of my more senior coworkers have told me that I have nothing to worry about :D) Since then, I've just kinda run with it. My boss still asks to see the source code, and I get tips from everyone in the team. Gotta keep sharp!
But you're right, 9 1/2 hours seems like a long enough workday :) I'll bet you're sorry you asked now haha
Yeah, might be a bit posh, Ms. Dinnerware with my name on it ;) Trust me, this is mature for him. You saw he sent me every letter of the alphabet while I was with you? And rap he'd written today... Surely you must do similar stuff with Sophage?
This is an essay. Should've just called, I guess :)

10/11/2014 21:31:52

Hayley
Not sorry at all, sounds pretty cool. although not sure I'd be quite as keen to get home after a long days work, and then carry on working. it's really cool though, impressive stuff :). Loool, touché. A rap?? That's hilarious. Yeh we've been known to do that sorta thing. Sophage and I, good times. Haha yeh you probs should have, but you didn't... Perhaps you don't want to talk to me :(:(.

10/11/2014 21:32:44

Hayley
Lol kidding, watching something with the rents anyway. can call you after if it's not too late perhaps? :)

10/11/2014 21:37:45

Me
Sounds good :)

11/11/2014 08:02:39

Me
Morning :) Just seen I've got a day of annual leave left this year, and I'd like to spend it with you.

11/11/2014 08:03:03

Me
Think you're free on Monday 1st? :)

11/11/2014 08:46:12

Hayley
Oooh, how lovely :). Only thing is my deadline is the week after, so I can't really make any promises until after that :(.

11/11/2014 13:34:22

Me
Oh right, forgot about that. How's Dec 15th instead? X

11/11/2014 14:12:27

Hayley
I'm gonna be in Vienna then, back on the 16th. The 1st might be ok, I just won't know until closer to the time... And I don't wanna mess you around :(

11/11/2014 18:18:20

Me
No worries :) Vienna's going to be awesome, btw. Very jelly. 
Just had a an American business guy spend about an hour explaining to us why UBS is the best thing ever. The hippie in me was screaming a bit :)
How's today been? X

11/11/2014 18:50:16

Hayley
Yeep, really looking forward to it :). Haha sounds, erm, interesting! Today's been a bit dull really... Finished work really early so made a cake to fill time. On the way to bowling now :)

11/11/2014 18:51:53

Hayley
Gonna hold on super tight to my scarf today!! It's been a week since the incident... :/

11/11/2014 19:45:03

Me
Finished work early? Now I'm getting really jelly. Can you bring some cake tomorrow? :P Have fun :)

11/11/2014 19:47:54

Me
If it happens again, I'm getting you the Dr Who scarf, you'll be able to track down the thief by following the end of it x

11/11/2014 20:21:19

Hayley
Yeh, lost concentration at around 4... Bit too early to stop really... But.. cake! Sure ill bring some of there's any left (unless it's gross) :). If only i was able to tell lies, free scarf!!

11/11/2014 21:13:38

Me
You're way too hard on yourself, that's still a solid day :) Just had a haircut, you'll probably be glad to know I resisted the temptation to get a buzz cut. 
Unfortunately, seems like my Gran's trying to compete with yours, she's back in hospital. She's being really upbeat though, she was asking for chocolate cake earlier. Love her, ha.
How'd you do bowling? X

11/11/2014 21:19:13

Hayley
Wow it really is a morbid relay... my grans headed home today.. gosh. Although asking for chocolate cake is a great sign! Hope she's ok. 
What is it with literally everyone having haircuts today?! Must be that time of year. And I would pretend otherwise but I would die a little if you got a buzzcut... 
Still bowling. And ahhhh just fucked up a turkeyyy fuuuuck!

11/11/2014 22:03:06

Me
Glad you've got some good news :) Yeah, my Gran's diabetic, but she'd get a chocolate IV drip if it came to it.
No buzzcut, don't worry. My brother's described it as "Fresh", if that's any indication. Now asking me for tips on sneaking into clubs at 17. Hmmm

11/11/2014 22:06:57

Hayley
You need to know the guy on the door, thats how we did it anyway haha! But that's really normal for someone his age, don't let it worry you!

11/11/2014 22:07:42

Hayley
Btw what time we meeting tomorrow? I'll be finished at uni around 5.x

11/11/2014 22:18:23

Me
I'd say 6 at Tower Hill? Finally haha x

11/11/2014 22:20:54

Hayley
Wooo sounds good!! Walking home from the station and really really need a pee! Gonna think if my cake that I'm gonna try when I get in too take my mind off it :):)

11/11/2014 22:21:07

Hayley
What ya up tooo? :)

11/11/2014 22:27:14

Me
Haha :) But is the scarf still there??
Catching up with my mum, she stayed late at the hospital. My gran sounds like she's going to do ok. How'd you do bowling? X

11/11/2014 22:43:19

Hayley
Yep! I was literally clutching it all the way home!
Oh that's good to hear, I'm glad! Hope your mum is doing ok too, can't be fun.
I did bowling ok, there seems to be no logic to whether you play well or badly... But good fun anyway. 
Omggggg just saw the coke Christmas advert!!! It's officially christmaaaaassss!!!!

11/11/2014 23:20:34

Me
Haha :) That's the universal starting signal. I'm really looking forward to seeing you x

11/11/2014 23:23:11

Me
Night x

11/11/2014 23:24:32

Hayley
Same :), niight.xxx

12/11/2014 17:54:56

Me
Hey, do you think you could meet me at Aldgate? X

12/11/2014 17:56:13

Me
Actually, I'll walk from there to Tower Hill. See you soon :)

12/11/2014 17:54:16

Hayley
At tower hill, waiting outside the exit just to the left :)

12/11/2014 17:56:57

Hayley
What's wrong with the tube? Hah. Want me to meet you half way?

12/11/2014 17:58:25

Hayley
I'll walk round to tower gateway at least. meet you there instead?

12/11/2014 17:59:35

Me
Not sure where that is, but I'll intend to head in that direction!

12/11/2014 18:00:32

Hayley
It a straight down the main road from aldgate :)

12/11/2014 18:08:10

Hayley
I'm across the road :)

12/11/2014 21:28:51

Hayley
There's a long queue -_-

12/11/2014 21:29:45

Me
Never a queue for the gents. OH NOW I GET WHY

12/11/2014 23:37:48

Me
That's awesome. Did you ask for a go? :)

12/11/2014 23:41:17

Hayley
Lool, unfortunately not, didn't wanna disturb his playing. I was so happy though when I walked out the tube and the first thing I heard was bagpipes!! Couldn't believe it!

12/11/2014 23:53:32

Me
What are the odds? Have to see if anywhere does classes haha :)

12/11/2014 23:55:02

Hayley
It was so awesome, I even put some money in his case :). Good idea!! I'll do that. You sort out the camping trip!x

13/11/2014 00:00:52

Me
I'd be totally up for that :) Be cool to try out some of my ancestry... Plus it's pretty awesome anyway. I'm serious about that trip, btw, just let me know when ;) x

13/11/2014 00:07:26

Hayley
Sweeet. Woo yay, I'm in! Erm.... I really don't know when would be best... But I'm sure we'll find a time! How exciting!x

13/11/2014 00:21:37

Hayley
Finally home.

13/11/2014 00:23:24

Me
Just got in too. Looking forward to Friday :D

13/11/2014 00:23:40

Me
Night Haze x

13/11/2014 00:27:31

Hayley
Sleep good joebert.xx

13/11/2014 18:10:58

Me
Hey :) How's today been? And what's the plan for tomorrow? X

13/11/2014 19:33:32

Hayley
Eugh today, don't know, still at it. And ummm don't know about tomorrow yet either. Let you know later? How're you?x

13/11/2014 21:06:44

Me
Everything alright?

13/11/2014 21:18:09

Hayley
Yep yep just 'in the zone', call you on my way home?

13/11/2014 21:18:31

Me
Sure :)

13/11/2014 22:01:56

Hayley
Whaddup homie?

13/11/2014 22:04:56

Me
Just chillin', brah. How's it hanging? :)

13/11/2014 22:05:37

Hayley
I'm so hungry and my brain feel a weirdddd

13/11/2014 22:07:02

Me
Eat. Sleep. Problems solved :)

13/11/2014 22:07:38

Hayley
No can do I'm afraid.

13/11/2014 22:07:51

Me
Then work hard, then come see me

13/11/2014 22:07:59

Hayley
Not for at least 20 mins anyway

13/11/2014 22:08:43

Me
You mean you don't carry emergency oat bars in your bag?

13/11/2014 22:09:18

Hayley
I actually do haha. But it's not THAT much of an emergency!!

13/11/2014 22:10:04

Hayley
Ok let's make at least one decision, what time should we meet? And where? So, two decisions :P

13/11/2014 22:11:07

Me
Chelmsford, literally right now

13/11/2014 22:11:52

Hayley
Although a lovely idea in principle...

13/11/2014 22:13:59

Me
...it's actually an amazing idea in reality too!

13/11/2014 22:15:42

Hayley
Apart from it being completely impractical! Yes it's a fantastic idea!

13/11/2014 22:19:16

Me
Oh, right, yeah. That's true. But still, the whole of London! We could go to a quiet pub, a raucous salsa place, a gig for bands we've never heard of, go for a night walk in a park, go to the movies, have a 'posh' (or not) dinner, go bowling, ice skating, an arcade, indoor golf, or just find a bench and make out for a bit. THERE ARE LITERALLY SO MANY OPTIONS

13/11/2014 22:21:01

Hayley
What a splendid attitude you have :). Cool beans cooool beeaaannss. Let's do one of the above. How about I meet you after work and then we can just go from there?

13/11/2014 22:28:07

Me
That sounds great. Liverpool Street for 6? :)

13/11/2014 22:30:39

Hayley
Sweeeet x

13/11/2014 22:38:39

Me
Let me know if anything starts to sound really good tomorrow. Home yet? :)

13/11/2014 22:39:19

Hayley
Indoor golf!!!!

13/11/2014 22:39:44

Hayley
Yep, rummaging through the kitchen as we speak

13/11/2014 22:46:07

Me
Just looked it up, it looks awesome, but we should pre-book for another time methinks. Last minute it's a leetle pricey...

13/11/2014 22:46:39

Me
Have something that isn't toast!

13/11/2014 22:46:57

Me
Or at least cut it into triangles first...

13/11/2014 22:47:51

Hayley
Omg does it actually exist?? I was just kidding haha, but actually it does sounds cool! Yeh another time :)

13/11/2014 22:48:12

Hayley
Hahaa! Managed to avoid toast tonight!!

13/11/2014 22:50:21

Me
Yeah, I went for my cousin's stag do :) Let's add it to the list. Medieval times? Still there. How's the progress on the bagpipe lessons? :P

13/11/2014 22:51:55

Hayley
Oh riiiight. Omg the list is growinggg!! Erm... Slow progress, been a bit busy! But chill, I'll sort it, at, some point.

13/11/2014 22:55:47

Me
Haha you don't have to actually book it! What did you go for (that wasn't toast?)

13/11/2014 23:01:59

Hayley
Hummus and pitta... So not much better!!

13/11/2014 23:17:10

Me
Still, not bad. Another set of crazy lunch combos today. Huge breakfast baguette and waffles for lunch. What makes it crazy? Had another huge breakfast baguette earlier. At breakfast.

13/11/2014 23:17:53

Hayley
Whoaaa, you're so crazy!!.

13/11/2014 23:18:05

Hayley
What's a breakfast baguette?

13/11/2014 23:18:59

Me
Sausage, egg, bacon, not sure if it had burger in there too... Maybe.

13/11/2014 23:19:37

Me
Anyways, enough about my lunch

13/11/2014 23:20:49

Me
Looking forward to tomorrow :) Kick your work's ass so you can kick back with me x

13/11/2014 23:21:26

Hayley
Lol alrighty will dooooo.x

13/11/2014 23:24:08

Me
Brill :) Night Hayley x

13/11/2014 23:24:37

Hayley

13/11/2014 23:25:15

Me
Bertjoe? Night Beth x

13/11/2014 23:25:54

Hayley
Yeh, like joebert, but backwarks :)

14/11/2014 00:06:16

Hayley
Sorry if you're asleep, hopefully your phone is on silent. But I was thinking, if you happen to miss your last train tomorrow, you'd have to come and stay with me, wouldn't you..? :)

14/11/2014 00:09:38

Me
What a terrible accident... :)

14/11/2014 00:10:50

Me
Or you could just come to Chelmsford x

14/11/2014 00:12:08

Me
Let's go for dinner in Chelmsford x

14/11/2014 00:12:32

Hayley
Not this weekend, but soon :)

14/11/2014 00:14:13

Me
Haha. There's a million things we can do tomorrow. Looking forward to picking one :) night xx

14/11/2014 08:49:16

Me
You're such a tease :P x

14/11/2014 09:16:39

Hayley
Hehe, I don't mean to be! And sorry if I woke/kept you up last night, I meant for you to see it on the morning!

14/11/2014 11:35:57

Hayley
Also, would it please be ok to meet at 6.30 tonight instead?x

14/11/2014 13:23:44

Me
Maybe just a little bit? No worries :)

14/11/2014 18:19:57

Hayley
Hey, got here a bit early. Let me know where to wait for you.x

15/11/2014 23:53:33

Me
This is not what I expected this weekend to turn out like. At all. 
It's been awesome :) I'm really looking forward to seeing you on Wednesday. Might call tomorrow evening? :)

15/11/2014 23:56:58

Me
And btw, it's really weird commuting commando. Really weird. X

16/11/2014 00:00:07

Hayley
Hehe, me neither. But it was fucking awesome, really had such a nice time with you :). Yay call me whenever :). Looooool!! I can imagine..!

16/11/2014 01:04:18

Hayley
You home yet?x

16/11/2014 01:04:33

Me
Just got home. Thanks for making this weekend so special.

16/11/2014 01:05:44

Hayley
Same to you :). Night night.xxx

16/11/2014 01:06:05

Me
Night Haze :) x

16/11/2014 12:22:36

Me
Wish we were cuddling right now...

16/11/2014 12:40:20

Hayley
Me too. So much colder without you to snuggle up with.x

16/11/2014 13:26:32

Me
Accepted your request. Glad we're actually friends now :)

16/11/2014 13:31:48

Hayley
Yay, now I can stalk you properly!!

16/11/2014 15:17:08

Me
Stalk away :) Sorry about the delay, been having dinner with my Grandad. My Gran's had some scans, it's not looking good, so we're trying to give him a bit of a break from being at her bedside. 
Been able to get much work done today? X

16/11/2014 15:51:49

Hayley
No worries! Oh I'm sorry to hear that :( nice to give your g-dad a bit of a break, hope he's doing ok.
Ermm, some, keep getting distracted. You?

16/11/2014 16:45:12

Me
Bit of a tough time right now, but he's alright. Haven't managed to get anything done myself today, so you're doing better than me! We've had a power cut, so no project or Facebook stalking you for a bit, either. Must remember to download Road Trip at some point, too...

16/11/2014 17:58:30

Hayley
Power cut? How unfortunate! Hehe yeh download it and we can watch it next time :). My whole body is aching today, not sure whether to go for a run... Night make matters worse?

16/11/2014 18:35:16

Me
Got power now! Still no lights, though.
Your whole body aches? I'm sorry! (/a little bit proud). I really hope it's not bad. Do you think you might?
Btw, I know you said next weekend might not be the best time, so no worries if not, but I've just heard I'll be home alone.
Sending you that Bhangra song on fb now x

16/11/2014 18:39:44

Hayley
Haha, yeh still a bit tired even though I actually managed to sleep last night! Oooh, interesting, home alone the whole weekend or...?

16/11/2014 19:32:35

Me
Just spoke to my parents, sounds like their plans changed a bit because of what's happening with my Gran. Now, my mum and brother are out all day and again at night on Saturday, and everyone's away Sunday.
Did you go for your run? X

16/11/2014 22:14:32

Me
27th July :) x

16/11/2014 22:15:31

Me
We moved from tinder a couple days after first messaging there, so probably 25th x

17/11/2014 10:05:36

Hayley
Boejert. Lol.

17/11/2014 13:19:02

Me
Lolz. Just remembered I picked you up :D

17/11/2014 13:19:57

Hayley
Yes you did. Wasn't that fun.

17/11/2014 13:29:24

Me
I thought so. Wait, don't we have to stop seeing each other now?...

17/11/2014 13:30:03

Hayley
Well you did break the rules...

17/11/2014 13:41:26

Me
Yeah, I kinda did... :)

17/11/2014 13:53:47

Hayley
Hmpf, I guess I'll forgive you. But know because you're so sexy.

17/11/2014 17:41:05

Me
You're unreasonably hot, Haze x

17/11/2014 17:43:07

Hayley
Just realised my typo!! *only. Only because you're so sexy. Know because you're so sexy makes no sense. And thankya :)

17/11/2014 19:40:45

Me
...and unreasonably cute :) To think, what were the chances we could have both walked into that coffee shop in Liverpool Street? Haha. Did you get much work done today? X

17/11/2014 19:49:34

Hayley
Haha, so thats what we're going with? Will have to flesh it out a bit me thinks. Yeh today was good thanks, just packing up now, gonna go for a run!  Hows your day? :)

17/11/2014 20:00:22

Me
Well I quite liked the secret underground Orient Express story... :)
Glad today went well. Enjoy the run! Today's been good, but just found out my Gran's switched to palliative care. Nothing we didn't know already. Luckily, she's still got a great sense of humour :)
Can't wait to see you x

17/11/2014 20:27:57

Hayley
Yeh, me too actually :). Enjoy? More like endure, need to invest in some earmuffs asap!
Oh I'm sorry to hear that :(. I hope everyone is ok? How're you doing?
I really can't wait to see you either!xx

17/11/2014 20:33:28

Hayley
Let me know if you can / wanna chat later.xxx

17/11/2014 20:45:10

Me
I'll call in about an hour :) x

17/11/2014 20:55:09

Hayley
Call-io

17/11/2014 20:55:29

Hayley
(Like coolio, but about calling... geddit? Ahahha :))

18/11/2014 07:47:04

Me
I'm a lucky guy x

18/11/2014 08:06:52

Hayley
������

18/11/2014 13:29:21

Hayley
Can't wait for tomorrow :)xx

18/11/2014 17:44:37

Me
Me neither. Miss you. How's today been? X

18/11/2014 18:20:02

Hayley
S'been ok. Half day of pointless lectures and half day of relative productivity. Gonna work as late as I can tonight, not sure whether to skip bowling...
Hows your day?x

18/11/2014 19:40:40

Me
Considering how useless you knew they'd be, at least half's not bad! Guess it depends on how much you'd get done? 
Today's been pretty standard really, but having my grandad round for dinner later. Any ideas for where we could hang out tomorrow? :) X

18/11/2014 20:02:50

Hayley
Went bowling in the end, didn't wanna let my bowl buddy down!
Oh cool, give him a hug from me (unless that's super inappropes).
Um nope... We can just find somewhere to chill?x

18/11/2014 21:51:49

Me
Grandad's just gone, good to have a chat. Plus he had some old photos he wanted printed, so got to see what my great-grandad looked like. (The prisoner from Great Expectations, in case you were wondering).
How'd you do? Did you set your bowl buddy up? X

18/11/2014 22:13:57

Hayley
Ey thats cool!!! I was wondering, thanks for clearing that up :)
I did ok... Although we played four games which I now regret cos I'm knackered, it's got really late, and I have to be up early tomorrow. But good fun. hehe not yet, although we're Facebook friends now so step one is complete :).
How you doing?x

18/11/2014 22:36:31

Me
Glad you enjoyed it, though :) Step one? Sounds like there's quite the plan going on. 
Lots of chats with family at the mo, which to be honest is quite a good thing really. Other than that things are going pretty well. Hope you get some sleep! I'm really looking forward to seeing you. Night Haze :) x

19/11/2014 12:30:14

Me
Seeing you later :)

19/11/2014 12:35:23

Hayley
Yeh, where're we meeting? Time?x

19/11/2014 13:34:57

Me
Erm, how's St James' Park at 6.30 for you? :)

19/11/2014 13:42:26

Me
I am an actual fucking idiot. Thought St James Park was actually a park.

19/11/2014 13:49:53

Me
Or maybe it is? Just ignore me atm

19/11/2014 13:59:10

Hayley
It is a park! But should we meet at the station then? 6.30 :)

19/11/2014 15:25:38

Me
See you there :D

19/11/2014 18:27:19

Hayley
At the 55 Broadway exit!

19/11/2014 23:20:21

Hayley
Wow, it's so late! We should really be more careful midweek. Hope you don't get home too late. And sorry again for the moodiness at the start, guess I took getting 'blanked' harder than I thought... 
Cannot wait for saturday! �� xxxx

19/11/2014 23:25:02

Me
Still can't believe you thought I'd lost interest! Cor. Listening to Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo on the train now :D Let me know when you get in :) x

19/11/2014 23:26:05

Hayley
yeh well, you know... 
Omg I'm gonna do the same!! Will do.x

19/11/2014 23:26:47

Me
And yeah, Saturday can't come quick enough xx

19/11/2014 23:29:33

Hayley
Marinade the nether rod, in the squish mitten... Squish mitten?!?!? Lol!!

19/11/2014 23:36:56

Me
Squish mitten should probably not be the term...

19/11/2014 23:43:58

Hayley
Ah we forgot to go through them to find out which ones work best...!

19/11/2014 23:54:06

Hayley
Just got in. Let me know when you're back safe.x

19/11/2014 23:56:34

Me
We've gotta figure it out at some point :) Will do x

19/11/2014 23:58:43

Me
Fingerhut?

19/11/2014 23:59:20

Hayley
Ew

20/11/2014 00:03:24

Me
...snatch? Pussy is my fav so far x

20/11/2014 00:09:53

Hayley
Not particularly keen on either...

20/11/2014 00:10:08

Hayley
Might be different hearing you actually say it though...

20/11/2014 00:13:34

Me
Yeah, not sure anything will be particularly appealing to read in a text :/ Just got in. Really enjoyed tonight!

20/11/2014 00:13:50

Me
Sleep well, Hayley :) xx

20/11/2014 00:18:19

Hayley
Night Joebert. Sweet dreams.xxx

20/11/2014 14:23:21

Hayley
I've literally changed your name to Joebert in my phone. Guess it's a proper thing now :).

20/11/2014 18:04:23

Me
Jeez, sounds like this thing's here to stay. Not that that's a bad thing :) How's Haze been today? X

20/11/2014 18:22:17

Hayley
Haha! Can change it back if you'd prefer?
Been ok, so bored though, and done too much staring out the window thinking about life.... Hows your day?x

20/11/2014 20:04:24

Me
No, I like that I have a nickname :) Well at least your weekend won't be boring... :P Thinking about life? Hope it's the good kind. 
Yeah, my day's been fine really, sounds much the same as yours. Having another dinner with my Grandad soon x

20/11/2014 20:34:36

Hayley
Hehe, it might be... Although I'm pretty sure it's gonna be far from boring!!
Yeh, thinking about the past year and thinking about next year and how shit might go down and that. Oh right, enjoy :). Hope he's doing ok.x

20/11/2014 21:22:00

Me
How shit might go down? Sounds like next year might involve a bank heist or summat. No worries, everything'll be fine :)
At the moment, he's performing a fashion critique on Michael Portillo's jacket and sunglasses combo. An interesting new side to my Grandad. How's the evening been? X

20/11/2014 21:56:20

Hayley
Lol, bank heist might be more fun even! Hehe that's cool, who knew he was a fashionista! S'been ok, tried to work a bit late and now chilling with mama watching scrappy tv.x

20/11/2014 22:41:02

Me
Good on you with the work. Trying to take a leaf out of your book and get the new laptop set up (arrived today :)) then to bed methinks, been a yawny day. G'Night Haze x

20/11/2014 22:43:09

Hayley
Ooh how exciting :). Yeh I'm not surprised! Night boejert, sleep well.xxx

20/11/2014 22:45:52

Me
Haha Boejert. Night :) xx

21/11/2014 08:50:20

Me
You're gorgeous.
At the risk of repeating myself, really can't wait to see you tomorrow :)

21/11/2014 10:55:28

Hayley
You're awesome and I can't wait for tomorrow either!!

21/11/2014 11:32:28

Hayley
Like, I can't really deal with how awesome you are.

21/11/2014 11:33:19

Hayley
I've been trying to comprehend it, but I can't, so I've had to pick up my phone and text you about it...

21/11/2014 18:13:14

Me
Not sure I really deserve all that, but I'll take the ego boost anyways :) thanks. How's the day been? X

21/11/2014 18:22:07

Hayley
Why not??? You definitely do you poobutt.

21/11/2014 18:22:58

Hayley
Today's been a bit of a mixed bag really. Looking forward to heading home in a bit and quite thankful that tomorrow if nearly today!!! How're you????xxx

21/11/2014 18:36:21

Me
Lolz. Thanks, probably why someone as awesome as you would go for me :) Mixed bag? Sounds like some shit went down. Bad day of heisting? 
Today's been the most interesting day of work I've had for a couple weeks, good for getting re-motivated :)
Tomorrow's so close! :) x

21/11/2014 18:40:38

Hayley
Hah, no, very little heisting occurred today as a matter of fact !
Hmm very cryptic, hope everything's ok...?
What you up to this evening?x

21/11/2014 20:43:40

Me
Everything's fine, meant interesting as in tough (but solveable) problems to work on. 
Took a detour on the way home to visit my Grandparents. Just got home now, so not sure what the plan is really. Might do some project work... How about you? X

21/11/2014 20:48:57

Me
And why was today a mixed bag?? X

21/11/2014 22:18:08

Hayley
Oooh right! That's cool then :). Oh that's nice, how are they doing? Project work? On a Friday? That's commitment! 
Went for dinner with my friends and now back to jackys place for tea :). Oh, just a jumble of emotions!

21/11/2014 22:43:31

Me
The Grandparents are doing ok, they'll be busy with lots of visitors tomorrow. Good to get a visit in tonight instead. Someone's told my Gran about you, he had a big grin as soon as she saw me.
Didn't get any project work done in the end, watched I'm a celeb with my Dad instead. Much wiser time investment :) For a second, thought you meant a second meal. Enjoy! Jumble of emotions sounds a bit rubbish. Let me know if you wanna talk x

21/11/2014 23:14:28

Hayley
Aww that's awesome :) !!
Lol I'm a celeb, must say I have been watching it, gotta love a bit of ant and Dec!

21/11/2014 23:15:16

Hayley
Omg no, couldn't eat another bite at this point, just had a tea. home now, gonna get ready for bed etc. Wanna chat a bit before bed or will it be too late? :)

21/11/2014 23:40:28

Hayley
I'll call you in 2 mins even if its just to say goodnight :)

21/11/2014 23:41:56

Me
Sounds good :)

22/11/2014 11:58:51

Me
Brunchy thing ended up becoming a lunchy thing, sorry. Is about 2 ok? Not long now :D x

22/11/2014 12:01:54

Hayley
No probs, Sophage is coming over for breakfast anyway so will probs be a bit after 2. Woooo yayay x

22/11/2014 12:29:53

Me
That's really good! See you soon :)

22/11/2014 13:02:15

Hayley
Yet probs be there around 3 ish .. hope thats ok!!!

22/11/2014 13:24:00

Me
That's great :)

22/11/2014 14:37:23

Me
Can't wait for you to get here x

22/11/2014 15:08:13

Hayley
I'm here :)

23/11/2014 20:36:43

Me
You're fucking awesome. Can't wait to hang out on Wednesday. Why does the week go so slowly but the weekends so quickly?? X

23/11/2014 21:18:47

Me
It is actually super depressing now :(

23/11/2014 21:27:01

Hayley
Had such an amazing time with you this weekend, miss you already :(. I know, had to go and buy some chocolate to console myself!

23/11/2014 22:11:11

Me
It's been incredible. Going to be a bit sad not waking up next to you. Although you won't be bothered by my snoring :) x

23/11/2014 23:03:12

Me
You've got that song stuck in my head now. Garghhh

23/11/2014 23:04:42

Hayley
Haha, m'apologies sire. I've got you stuck in my head!

23/11/2014 23:04:58

Hayley
I agree, although I think I'd take the snoring to be able to wake up with you :)
Get much project done?x

23/11/2014 23:26:19

Me
Got a fair bit done :) Amazed that we can have such a fun time just cuddling. Could easily do that for another night now :) Although do quite need to catch up on some sleep haha x

23/11/2014 23:28:29

Hayley
Nice one!! I could do it forever!! surely at some point we'll just be able to sleep normally as part of it :)

23/11/2014 23:39:09

Me
Really wishing you were still here right now. Definitely :) I feel so comfortable with you and only getting more so. Thanks again for making the weekend amazing x

23/11/2014 23:46:25

Hayley
It's actually kinda crazy how comfortable I feel with you! It's so awesome though. No, thank you!!! Can't wait to see you asap!xxx

23/11/2014 23:48:59

Me
Neither can I. Night Hayley, sleep well :) x

23/11/2014 23:49:38

Hayley
Nighty night sexy joebert xxx

24/11/2014 10:36:28

Hayley
That song I was playing over and over on the weekend has 140million odd plays on spotify... I think I only contributed to a couple million or so!

24/11/2014 12:31:53

Me
Haha, yeah thanks for that! Been in my head all day :)
Also, how can I be missing you this much already??

24/11/2014 12:34:41

Hayley
Cos life is better when we're spending time together. thus whilst apart it feels like something is missing.x

24/11/2014 17:55:03

Me
It really is. You're one of the best things that ever happened to me x

24/11/2014 17:59:51

Me
Anyway, being very sappy today. How's it been? X

24/11/2014 18:08:28

Hayley
Nowt wrong with a bit of sap �� !!!
Today's alright, working well enough at uni. How was yours?xx

24/11/2014 18:27:09

Me
Good :) Today's been ok, got some work done. Still though, always a bit of a downer after the weekend. Getting a lot more project done on the train, that was a good idea. Leaves more time for other stuff :) How's the evening looking? X

24/11/2014 18:41:09

Hayley
That's cool, it's so impressive how you work all day and then carry on working more after work! Good stuff :).
Evenings looking ok, thought I'd head to Hp Soc for a bit seeing as I'm in town, hoping not to stay too late though. yours? :)

24/11/2014 19:14:32

Me
Thanks :) Well the idea is to stop, really. Hopefully have a bit more of a divide between work and home, and be able to 'switch off' a bit easier. 
Sounds good, another chanted viewing? Going to make the most of the train productivity and get back in the gym. Or at least do some push ups x

24/11/2014 20:08:10

Hayley
That sounds like a brilliant plan! Definitely good to have more of a distinction!! 
Haha nah, just quizzes and that today, bit boring tbh... Ooh good idea! I was thinking today I really need to get back on the exercise - my legs are all achy haha, need to stretch before sleepovers in the future!x

24/11/2014 21:18:07

Me
Seems like it'll work well :) How did you do? Bet you must've trounced the lot. 
Probably quite a good idea, think we both had the odd cramp here and there. As with most things though, practice makes perfect ;) x

24/11/2014 21:21:53

Hayley
I was a bit bored actually at the start and then I turned really hyper for some reason and then it was really fun. Seem to be in a super good mood atm, was singing while walking to the station, wanna hear a bit? 
And yehh man, practiceeee shall make perfect, although you're pretty perfect already!

24/11/2014 21:24:06

Hayley
On the traaaaiinnnn. Will call in 2 mins.x

24/11/2014 21:24:35

Me

Hayley
Ok I'm getting of the train in like 10 seconds

24/11/2014 21:43:39

Me
I have never felt this guilty before... And I intentionally outran my brother so he'd get stung by bees once

24/11/2014 21:45:35

Me
GUILLLLLTY

24/11/2014 22:11:36

Me
Here's the proposed forfeit - I will attempt to sing a song of your choosing.

25/11/2014 07:53:47

Me
Morning. Really hope you have a good day :)

25/11/2014 08:01:08

Hayley
I hope you do too :). Sleep ok?x

25/11/2014 08:02:50

Me
Out like a light. Definitely needed it! How about you? X

25/11/2014 08:05:14

Hayley
Oh good! Yeh slept fine thanks, probs stayed up a bit too late but eh well!

25/11/2014 08:07:55

Me
:) Did you see the clip I sent?

25/11/2014 08:13:26

Hayley
Just saw it! Really wanna watch that movie now!

25/11/2014 08:16:19

Me
I love Hot Rod, totally up for a re-watch. And bagpipes!! X

25/11/2014 08:18:11

Hayley
Sounds like a plan :)

25/11/2014 08:38:11

Me
Sweet. I'll get downloading :) x

25/11/2014 18:34:59

Me
Somehow, I'm not even remotely bored of that song :) Haven't got much signal, but the first 30 seconds sound good! How's the day been? X

25/11/2014 18:48:24

Hayley
Tbh I'm pretty bored of it now, but that version is quite cool. Day has been a total fail haha, grandad didn't clear out the study till like 11 and then I just couldn't concentrate. But ah wellll! Tomorrow is another day! Off to bowling now :). How was your day? :)

25/11/2014 19:49:04

Me
Really? I made a note today to get it on the iPod! That's a shame :( Was it just one of those days that didn't quite start? Have fun bowling! Let me know how you get on. 
Mine was alright, walked halfway to the gym (in the rain) before my dad picked me up to see my Gran again. Now in the car on the way back to the gym. Round 2! X

25/11/2014 20:10:06

Hayley
You still should, it's still a tune! Yeh pretty much, not the end of the world though. Hows your gran doing? Have fun at the gym :)

25/11/2014 21:45:17

Me
Hopefully it can be made up tomorrow :) My Gran's alright. My Dad asked her if she was comfortable, because she kept shifting, and she said- Yes, you just have that effect on me. Haha :)
Gym was good, really needed it. Definitely getting the bug again.
How'd you do bowling? :)X

25/11/2014 22:26:44

Me
Seeing you tomorrow :D

25/11/2014 23:26:48

Hayley
Didn't mean to stay out so late and now there's ages until my train booo :(. But yay seeing you tomorrow. What's the plan???!xx

25/11/2014 23:26:55

Hayley
Aw she's awesome! Glad she's still in good spirits! Ah cool glad to hear it, you should defs pass that bug on to me!
Bowling was a bit lame really, but then after there was a lane still on so I kept playing and then got a sneaky coaching lesson from the dude! Only just on the way home now, but so excited for next week to try out what I learnt properly!

25/11/2014 23:54:47

Me
Sounds like an awesome session :D Totally making sure we're on the same team if we ever do bowl in a group. 
For tomorrow, would you mind texting me when you know roughly when you can leave? Then maybe that pub at King's Cross? If not, we can always walk around and find somewhere there and then :) x

25/11/2014 23:57:34

Hayley
I'd like to think we'd be in the same team anyway ! :)
Yh sure, sorry I forgot to check with mum. Will let you know. Probs be around 6 or just after. Kings x sounds good :), can get there quickly too.x

26/11/2014 00:03:30

Me
Hopefully! Sounds good to me. Miss your face :)

26/11/2014 00:03:58

Me
Are you back safe yet?

26/11/2014 00:04:58

Hayley
Miss your face tooo, gonna see it tomorrow woooo. Still on the train boooo. Should be home in a bit though xx

26/11/2014 00:10:18

Me
Can't wait. Do text to let me know when you get in! Get the impression tomorrow morning might be a bit of a struggle, although does sound totally worth it! :)

26/11/2014 00:11:59

Hayley
Will do. A struggle for me? Nah I'll just wake up a bit later! Don't stay up for me btw, I'm almost home!xx

26/11/2014 00:14:20

Me
Ah, well, in that case... Night Haze (and Thanks :) x

26/11/2014 00:25:24

Hayley

26/11/2014 08:47:34

Hayley
Hey,  turns out my bro's home today so I can meet you any time :) (within reason).x

26/11/2014 08:58:28

Me
Sweet. Like the disclaimer, btw :) If it's still good for you, Kings Cross at 6 would suit me. See you later :D x

26/11/2014 08:59:40

Hayley
Sounds good. Yaya see you laterrr. Have a good day :):)

26/11/2014 17:57:11

Hayley
Hehe no worries! Looking forward to tomorrow's song choice :)

26/11/2014 23:37:23

Hayley
A blast eh? Yeh, it's my favourite part of the week :). Sleep well joebert.xxx

27/11/2014 07:18:40

Hayley
Bit of bad news this morning unfortunately, grandma's passed away. Not sure what it means for our weekend plans but will let you know.xx

27/11/2014 07:42:08

Me
I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope you and your family are ok. If there's anything I can do, please let me know. Thinking of you x

27/11/2014 09:58:37

Hayley

27/11/2014 18:38:27

Me
That's good :) No worries. Today's been alright, missing you but otherwise ok. Hope yours has been as good as it can. How's the family doing? X

27/11/2014 18:41:31

Hayley
Yer, s'been fine, did a bit of work and helped mum and dad out with some stuff. Family are doing fine mostly, all mobilised to get things sorted for funeral / prayers on the weekend.x

27/11/2014 18:55:55

Keeping busy is a good thing. Sounds like it's going to be a tough week ahead. Always here if you want to talk x

27/11/2014 18:57:49

Hayley
Thanks, appreciate it. Will try and call you later, been missing you too!xx

27/11/2014 23:13:14

Hayley
Hey Joe, I think we should meet up in town tomorrow after work, maybe go cinema or something chilled? Would that be ok?

27/11/2014 23:13:32

Hayley
Also sorry for the late reply! Had to speak to fams.x

27/11/2014 23:19:22

Me
That sounds great :) No worries, do let me know if anything changes inbetween. There's some good stuff in the cinema at the moment. It'd be nice to just see you anyway x

27/11/2014 23:20:19

Hayley
Ok cool beans, where/when should I meet you?

27/11/2014 23:32:59

Me
Well what would you rather see, Gone Girl, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Maze Runner, or (I can hear your reaction now) Hunger Games? My choice, Imitation Game, isn't on at the right time :(

27/11/2014 23:34:21

Me
Or Interstellar

28/11/2014 10:15:53

28/11/2014 13:31:08

Hayley
Yayayayaaa. I think I'll be there just after 6, cos it's either that or be super early. I'm SO excited to see you, it's a bit extreme really...xxxxx

28/11/2014 14:00:03

Hayley

Hayley
Yeh we're ok here at the mo, I literally only just finished the ironing, looong. You sure you're ok? How're your mum and dad doing?x

29/11/2014 16:20:35

Me
Jeez, that took most of the day?? I'm really ok, thanks though :) My mum and dad are doing alright, I think at this point they've accepted it and it's more of a relief really. My Grandad's doing well too. Lots of long talks at the moment. Did you have breakfast with Sophage? :)

29/11/2014 16:42:59

Hayley
Yer, had to keep taking breaks, its tiring work! Ok thats good I guess. Give them a hug from me anyway, and give yourself one too! 
Nah I didn't, might go later for dinner tho, not sure.x

29/11/2014 16:53:12

Me
Thanks Hayley, and the same back to you :) Hope that you're still doing ok. I thought folks were coming over today? Xx

29/11/2014 16:54:18

Hayley
Nah, it all kicks of tomorrow morning nowt going on today.x

29/11/2014 18:58:11

Me
Oh right gotcha. Did you decide to go for that dinner? Just came back (again). Sorry about the delay. Everyone's home now. How's the rest of the day gone (aside from the ludicrous amounts of ironing)? X

29/11/2014 19:22:59

Hayley
Yeh, sushi with Sophage and mehmet :) and now we're watching elf :). You spending the evening at home? Day was ok, did the ironing, made a little something for my gdad and then went out to sophages. X

29/11/2014 19:53:51

Me
Oh good :) Elf! Love that movie. Really must be Christmas time. We should get around to picking the first Christmas market to visit :D Yup, home all night now. Up for a call when you get home? Ooh and what did you make your Grandad? X

29/11/2014 20:07:01

Hayley
Yehh christmaaas ����. Good movie for keeping the spirits up :). Ooh yay Xmas markets, you mean from the ones in London? Plenty to choose from :), yes defs up for a call later. Any time work best?
Oh just a little collage thing of the Oberlander stuff from the business, I'll send you a pic, it's nothing too special but hopefully it'll be appreciated.x

29/11/2014 20:54:45

Me
There's an emoticon for everything :) Yeah, although the other ones look good too. Quite like the look of the one at the south bank centre... 
About 10'd be a good time for the call :) The collage looks awesome! I'm sure he'll love it :D

29/11/2014 21:23:14

Hayley
Yeh I agree, although I think it's moved to the Tate modern this year, I remember reading something about that... Okies, I'll make sure to be home around 10 :). And thanks :)

29/11/2014 21:34:47

Me
I'll check it out :) There's no hurry! Stay as long as you would have, I'll be awake for hours yet. Say 10.30? Looking forward to hearing from you though :)

29/11/2014 21:48:49

Hayley
Ok, I'll stay a little. it longer, but itching to talk to you!!

30/11/2014 12:53:06

Me
Thinking of you. Hope you're okay :)

30/11/2014 13:23:13

Hayley
Thanks joebert. That was... An experience. turn out the guests do most of the manual labour... who knew. Heading back to the house now. How're you?

30/11/2014 14:04:18

Me
Oh, really?! Wow. Did you? Hope it went ok :) Having Sunday dinner with my Grandad now. Think he's alright. Always here if you need me :) x

30/11/2014 14:50:41

Hayley
Well it's the men that have to do it. But family members are given some special soil to scatter so i did that, was all a bit surreal. Oh thats nice, glad to hear he's doing ok. Thanks and same to you!xx

30/11/2014 16:28:03

Me
It sounds like that must've been tough, I hope it was okay. How's the event at yours going? X

30/11/2014 17:14:45

Hayley
Bit of a lul in between things atm, sooo tired. Hows your day?x

30/11/2014 18:19:07

Me
Can't blame you. Plus we did talk until 2AM :) Really enjoyed the story of the bumble bee and the penguin, too ��
Day's been productive, getting back into the swing of things. Are you in 'host mode' or have you been able to settle back a little bit? X

30/11/2014 18:21:05

Hayley
Miss youuuu. xxxx

30/11/2014 18:21:58

Me
�� Wish you were here or I was there. Miss you too x

30/11/2014 18:47:44

Hayley
������
Yuuuummmmy dinner. Wish I wasn't full so I could eat more! Hows project work going?x

30/11/2014 19:16:19

Me
Ooh could do with one of those. Took a break for a bit �� Oh, and I've changed the departing flight to Sunday morning. People starting to arrive now? X

30/11/2014 19:32:16

Hayley
Oooooh that's cool. Did you change it or just book a new one? Yeh they're starting to filter in now.xx

30/11/2014 20:17:41

Me
Just changed the departure. Wasn't difficult at all, really. More time now :) Just went and got some chocolates for my parents. Chocolate helps pretty much everything. Hope prayers are going well :) x

30/11/2014 20:37:39

Hayley
Ah nice. Aw you're so cute, that's really sweet! I defs agree with the chocolate thing :). Yeh all good, had to stand though and now soo tired. Nipped upstairs for a little rest but should probably go down and socialise with all these strangers again...

30/11/2014 20:44:18

Me
Have a nap for a bit :) It'll help, and when you do go back it'll be easier. You do the same thing as me at these sorts of things :) x

30/11/2014 20:46:57

Me
And also, by the way, I miss you so much it's ridiculous x

30/11/2014 20:53:27

Hayley
Nah, it's nearly bedtime anyway. I've just been sitting in the dark playing temple run 2 for a bit instead... So will probs head down again eugh. 
:(:( me too :(:(

30/11/2014 21:27:43

Hayley
Also, what times your flight on Sunday?x

30/11/2014 21:28:26

Me
Haha �� Probably a good idea then. Remembered from yesterday, would you mind sending me your address? Promise I won't visit tonight, don't worry �� Flight's at 8.30 x

30/11/2014 21:32:07

Hayley
What'd you remember from yesterday? 25 Selvage Lane, NW7 3SS :). And I'm not worried, that'd literally be awesome! But if you are planning on showing up ever, do give me some notice, just in case.xx

30/11/2014 22:18:51

Me
Just that we'd been talking about that. And no worries, I will :) How's it all going? X

30/11/2014 22:20:33

Hayley
S'going fine. Everyone finally went home then had to do a bit of clearing up.xx

30/11/2014 22:27:59

Me
Ah right. Hope all the family's ok too. I'd imagine you're probably looking forward to an early night tonight? X

30/11/2014 22:29:52

Hayley
Thanks, yeh we're l fine just tired now, long day! Yes actually, I'm just chilling now in be watching some tv. Yourself?x

30/11/2014 22:39:17

Me
I can imagine! Just had one of those long chats with the parents. They're all right. Now just getting ready for work in the morning, and probably to bed soon too. Do give those hugs! I have :) x

30/11/2014 22:42:41

Hayley
Aw thats nice, glad to hear they're doing ok! Woo glad you gave them, you said it was from me though yeh? I may have forgotten to give them, defs will do though!xx

30/11/2014 22:50:27

Me
I did, my mum laughed. No worries, might be a bit strange considering I've not met your mum yet (nor your Dad, really?), so it might not make sense x

30/11/2014 22:51:02

Hayley
I'm gonna do it anyway!!! They'll love it :)

30/11/2014 22:55:03

Hayley
Just did it, they said Aw thank you and sorry to hear about your bad news and hope you and your family are doing ok.x

30/11/2014 22:59:17

Me
Aww thanks. That's very sweet of them :)

30/11/2014 23:02:11

01/12/2014 18:18:10

Hayley
All good. Lots of people I don't remotely recognise but nice for my gdad that they all came :). I had a wee nap and now mekkin dinner. How was your day?x

01/12/2014 19:39:27

Me
That's really good! Shows that a lot of people care :) Thought you'd go for a nap sooner or later! It's been pretty good, been a productive one and glad to have a change of pace to be honest. Spent a fair amount of time willing Thursday to hurry up though :) More prayers tonight? X

Hmm clever loophole :) Listened to that Taylor Swift song with the "Boys only want love if it's torture" line. Nah.
Hope the work's going alright x

02/12/2014 16:55:22

Hayley
Lol, that's good. Torture doesn't sound particularly fun. Ooh, I've sent you a link to the mash up I was going on about on fb. I actually find the original kinda crappy now lol. Works going aiiite thanks, days going too fast though! Hope you're doing good :)x

02/12/2014 19:14:33

Me
Glad we definitely agree on that! On the train, but looking forward to listening soon :) Always after more music. My parents surprised me in London after work, so tonight not happening was actually quite well timed :) Ended up going to the fridge, too! Hope bowling goes well ��

02/12/2014 20:40:36

Hayley
Aw thats so cool!! And you got to go to the fridge again yay! Thanks ! First game went pretty well! :):). Hows the rest of your evening panning out?x

02/12/2014 21:42:31

Me
It just sounds like the "proper" version of what that song should be. Although the video does get a bit weird ��
How are the new tricks from the tuition working out? :) 
Evening's going well, phone calls from family, another hmm.. interesting chat with Jonny and now chilling with YouTube :) Enjoy the rest of the sesh xx

02/12/2014 22:22:27

Hayley
Haha yeh innit!! And now the original version just sounds weird! Worked out ok, first game was really good, flopped the second and then third went well again! An interesting chat with jonny eh? Hope it wasnt too awks... On my way home now. probs have a bit of a layover at kings x so might give you a call :)

03/12/2014 13:26:40

Me
Glad it's been at least a little less crappy :) Looking forward to that hug, and that kiss. And hearing you rap DMX ��

03/12/2014 13:32:05

Hayley
Yer.... No time to learn it today, will see what I can achieve in my way there!

03/12/2014 13:32:51

Me
No worries, I don't even know what I'm learning yet ��

03/12/2014 13:33:18

Hayley
Oh yeh... I'll have a think.x

03/12/2014 17:57:53

Me
Here :) at the south bank exit x

03/12/2014 18:10:46

Hayley
Walking round x

03/12/2014 23:23:10

Me
The last few days have been almost entirely crap, but this evening's definitely feeling like the beginning of getting over it. Thanks :)

03/12/2014 23:23:53

Me
I'll do my homework on the safety dance, too. DMX was coming on pretty great ��

Also, you are literally so cute and so sweet and I cannot wait to see you on Friday! ����

03/12/2014 23:28:04

Hayley
:(:( --> :):)
Sorry you've had a crappy few days, so glad that things are looking on the up though! Woooo I'm excited to hear it! I've been easy on you, it's basically the same lyrics repeated the entire song! Not like dmx...!!

03/12/2014 23:44:43

Me
I was just thinking - you look awesome (as ever) in that photo, but I can see how exhausted I am now! Was actually nodding off a bit until a drunk guy fell on me.
Can't wait for Friday either �� Yeah, they've been crappy, but really feeling so much better now. Hope you are too :) I'll get an EARLY night tomorrow, so there's enough brain to meet Sophage properly if that does happen.
You can always choose another one! X

04/12/2014 00:07:54

Hayley
Oh gosh, drunk people on trains are never nice! Early night tomorrow sounds like a good plan! Sorry for keeping you out so late tonight, I really have to stop that! Hope you get home safe joebert. Night xxx

04/12/2014 00:25:55

Me
Nah, you didn't, I did :) Home safe, hope you are too. Night Haze ��

04/12/2014 08:28:03

Hayley
Morning Joebert :). Hope you slept ok and that waking up wasn't too painful!! Hope you have a really good day!xxx

04/12/2014 10:43:30

Me
Morning Haze :) Thanks, but this morning has actually been pretty hellish. Bed at 9pm tonight! Hope yours has been a bit better ☺️

04/12/2014 10:54:22

Hayley
Oh nooo :(:(:( that's sucks to hear. We're not staying out past 10 anymore!!!

04/12/2014 14:37:39

Me
Rubbish! Course we are. Just maybe not on school nights :P And now, aside from being a bit sleepy, feeling SO MUCH better than yesterday :) Sorry if I was a bit of a misery guts.
Hope you're doing ok too �� Did you get in to uni? X

04/12/2014 15:26:30

Me
And also - tomorrow, Woo! X

04/12/2014 15:29:28

Hayley
Yeh, I meant on school nights! 
Yay good I'm so glad to hear that!! I'm sleepy aswell, just fell asleep reading through my friends work... Oops. Yeh got into uni, need to come in here more often! And woo tomorrow!! Although having spoken to my parents they're not mad keen on the idea of me having a boy over when grandads staying with us... Especially the first time he stays. So might have to be a change of plan. Haven't quite figured it out yet.x

04/12/2014 18:15:13

Me
Wow, sounds like we were both pretty gone today!
Is the thesis nearly done yet? Must surely be close now :) Don't forget to send me a copy, too ��
Ah no worries, plenty of other options for tomorrow. We'll figure summat out :) How'd the rest of the day go? X

04/12/2014 18:34:20

Hayley
Thought so but then my supervisor gave me a whole bunch of new stuff to do! Bit stressed about time now but should be ok! Can leave some things out if necessary. Days been good otherwise, would have liked to work a bit later but gotta head back, gotta go for prayers for my mums cousin that passed away. How was your day?x

04/12/2014 18:46:27

Me
That sucks! Don't stress though, you'll definitely get it done, no worries necessary :) 
If you need to, it's no problem if you want to cut down a bit on seeing me this weekend. Although that would suck balls��
Still though, option's there.
Sorry about your mum's cousin, I hope she and the rest of your family are ok!
My day went pretty well, work's quite interesting so just about managed not to fall unconscious. Looking forward to the early night :)
Can't wait to see you x

04/12/2014 21:03:39

Hayley
Hope you're not asleep yet. I still have no idea what's happening tomorrow...! Helppp!

05/12/2014 08:45:41

Me
Morning! Awesome couple days ahead :) Hope you get loads of work done today xx

05/12/2014 08:58:08

07/12/2014 08:04:54

Hayley
I decided to just get up and get ready, can sleep on the train! Awesome! Have a safe flight, let me know (when you can) when you land.xx

08/12/2014 20:59:50

Hayley
I agree, although I think I'd take the snoring to be able to wake up with you :)
Get much project done?x

09/12/2014 19:31:29

Me
Aside from a little turbulence, all went fine. Glad you're at least a bit better! No worries if you can't come, but it'd be damn cool if you can! If not, then hope the handover goes well �� Btw, saying hello properly is code for a big kiss, right? ;) x

09/12/2014 19:43:12

Hayley
Nah, I was just gonna wave at you enthusiastically for a bit...

09/12/2014 19:58:13

Me
Ah, in that case, ������

09/12/2014 20:11:46

Hayley
Hilarious! 
I just went to bowling and then turned around and went home again cos I felt sick :( booo :(, cba for this man!!

09/12/2014 20:19:14

Me
Sorry to hear that :( Have you got any chicken soup in? X

09/12/2014 20:29:11

Me
That's assuming cold sick rather than, well... sick sick. Hope you feel better! Are you back home? X

09/12/2014 20:33:37

Hayley
Nah probs not... I don't even know man, I think the weekend just screwed me up... Not enough sleep + not enough healthy food = ill Hayley. Gotta be more sensible! 
However i feel in the morning I'm going to go in and submit my work. and then if necessary I'll just come home and sleep! Should be fine.

09/12/2014 20:33:49

Hayley
Nearly home, on the train. you?x

09/12/2014 21:16:31

Me
That sucks. I had a bit of a sniffle myself, but sounds like this is something quite a bit worse. You've been working really hard, take it easy for a bit to sleep as much as you need :)
Do get well soon!
Oh and you sent me music!! Gahh

09/12/2014 21:17:53

Me
Was out getting dry cleaning and a couple bits, but back to a huge bowl of chicken salad, a pint of water and a decent internet connection now. Home!

09/12/2014 21:18:04

Me
Are you getting an early night then? X

09/12/2014 21:25:40

Hayley
Nah it's not too bad, I'll be fine! Yeh I sent you a music, figured I'd carry on the tradition! 
Ooh chicken salad, sounds yum! I want some! Need to start eating more salads... Yeh early ish probably, you?x

09/12/2014 21:58:46

Me
Oh good :) Glad you kept it going, I'll be back on schedule now! I've got a few German songs to add, too ��
Salad was a bit of a welcome reprieve from all the stodginess of schnitzel, sausage, fried potato and cake actually! Although doesn't quite fill you up as much...
Think I'll be joining you! Not really fancying work tomorrow but gotta get back to it. Well done again! Must be a big relief to be finally finished ������

09/12/2014 22:11:31

Hayley
Ooh cool, looking forward to the German music :). Lol!! Maybe not, but your insides will thank you! S'alright. You only got a three day week to handle at least :). 
Thannkkkss. Probably will tomorrow once it's handed in! X

09/12/2014 22:19:12

Hayley
If you can, call me quickly before you sleep so i can say goodnight :). Don't worry if you can't xx

09/12/2014 23:16:18

Hayley
Oops, called by accident! Sorry! Night joebert.xxxxxxxx

10/12/2014 12:00:10

Hayley

10/12/2014 12:35:05

Me
No worries! Hope hand in goes smoothly, looking forward to tomorrow :) x

10/12/2014 14:59:16

Oh, erm, am I? What's happening? ��

10/12/2014 15:29:28

Me
How are you celebrating? X

10/12/2014 15:35:41

Hayley
Heh yeh, nothing special, I just need you to keep that day free for me :). 
I'm not really... I don't have anything to do and didn't wanna just go home and sit around all alone so I'm just chilling here in the office waiting for the others to submit and then we might go for a drink or something... if I can get out of going to the uni thing tonight I'm thinking of maybe coming to see you quickly after work just for a quick hug :)

10/12/2014 17:43:13

Me
Ooh, nothing special, eh? Sounds exciting. I'm working the 23rd and 24th, but I'll keep that evening clear :)
Naww! We'll celebrate tomorrow ��
Are you here? I'll be out soon xx

10/12/2014 17:46:58

Hayley
Hehe yeh I'm nearly there!  Didn't know whether you would see my message so my plan was just to show up and wait around either way... Hope thats ok and not too stalkerish...! :/ xx

10/12/2014 17:47:49

Hayley
Hehe yeh I'm nearly there!  Didn't know whether you would see my message so my plan was just to show up and wait around either way... Hope thats ok and not too stalkerish...! :/ xx

Me
Approaching boots x

10/12/2014 18:01:48

Me
And of course not! It'll be good to see you :)

10/12/2014 23:00:14

Hayley
I got it wrong, we gotta meet them at Hyde park tomorrow at 7 - will still meet at Liverpool street at 6 though :). I might stay in the tube station so I don't have to tap out... Would that be ok?x

10/12/2014 23:00:59

Hayley
Also, I literally had such a nice time tonight. Thanks for helping me celebrate and thanks for existing and being part of my life ��������

10/12/2014 23:13:28

Me
Sure, sounds good :) 
As did I! The spontaneous nights are always the best. Congrats again on today, hope you enjoy a well-earned Netflix binge tomorrow �� Thanks again for coming by! xx

10/12/2014 23:14:15

Me
And yeah, I'm really glad you exist too :) x

10/12/2014 23:31:19

Hayley
Thanks joebert!! Wooo Yaya :):). I'm home btw, hope you're not too far !

10/12/2014 23:32:48

Hayley
Also, are you defs sure its cool for me to stay over Friday ? Mum needs to know whether to book me a ticket to the airport or not... Turns out flight is at about 6pm on Sat...

10/12/2014 23:57:47

11/12/2014 08:04:21

Hayley
Lie in failed...

11/12/2014 08:14:10

Me
Morning! Oh, why? X

11/12/2014 08:33:57

Hayley
Just woke up innit... Had a reallyyyy weird dream that my house was getting burgled and then we made friends with the culprits. Strange. Anyway have an awesome day :)xx

11/12/2014 13:06:41

Me
That's a surprisingly positive ending :) bit jealous, your dreams are always amazingly surreal! How's the freedom feeling? X

11/12/2014 13:09:20

Hayley
It wasn't all that pleasant a dream really. woke up feeling quite paranoid... We only made friends with them so that they didn't harm us...Not much to be jealous of!
S'alright... Bit bored, would prefer to be busy. really really looking forward to seeing you later though!!! Hows your day going?x

11/12/2014 13:40:26

Me
Oh, well in that case, that sucks! �� If I was there, if use my Kung Fu skills to fend them off.
Same, can't wait :D Today's going well, not tired and doing some interesting stuff, so I'm a happy bunny. Have you exhausted Netflix yet? What's the next item on the agenda? Mid-day bowling? �� x

11/12/2014 13:47:29

Hayley
Haha good to know you've got those skills at your disposal :). That's awesome! Wish I was doing some interesting stuff... :(. Lol nah, not quite yet, watching a movie and contemplating either doing some baking or going for a run...

11/12/2014 16:54:55

Hayley
Hey joebert, I'm gonna be there around 5-10 past 6. Hope thats ok.x

11/12/2014 17:45:48

Me
Awesome. See you soon :)

11/12/2014 17:49:21

Hayley
Would you be able to pick me up a bottle of water please? Forgot to get one from home and I'm dying.x

11/12/2014 17:57:11

Me
Will do :) x

11/12/2014 17:58:40

Hayley

11/12/2014 18:07:43

12/12/2014 00:08:50

12/12/2014 00:09:27

12/12/2014 00:20:05

Me
Sorry about the delay, had to sort some bits with Sam (Everything's fine btw, just needed help moving a body).

12/12/2014 00:22:49

Me
Bad jokes aside, all sorted now. Night Hayley! Looking forward to tomorrow evening xx

12/12/2014 00:25:02

12/12/2014 09:43:55

Me
Oh, and can't wait to see your gorgeous face later ��

12/12/2014 10:07:59

Hayley
Morning joebert!!! What do you mean thank me? Thank you!!!!!!!!! :):)
Erm, not really... Spend some time with my sister cos I haven't for a while, and then, yeh, packing and then coming to meet you!!! What time btw should I meet you?

12/12/2014 10:11:02

Hayley
And Wooo can't what either ����������

12/12/2014 13:07:32

Me
My pleasure! It was good to see everyone and put some names to faces. It is a bit difficult to know what to do or say, but hopefully didn't come across too badly! Looking forward to having proper chats :)
What's the plan with your sister? Please say hi from me :)
Could you come for just before 6, say 5.50? Means we can get a good one.
Been a pretty weird day, I can't stop thinking about you. Quite raunchy stuff, too. Hope you don't mind ;) x

12/12/2014 13:17:47

Hayley
Yeh, can be a bit awks but I think it went really well :). Well at the mo she's napping and I'm watching family fortunes, I should really get packing though... Sure thing, will be there at 17:47 hopefully. Loool! Course I don't mind, thats pretty much what I spend my whole life doing! But don't get too excited, just gonna be cuddles tonight!xx

12/12/2014 13:18:34

Hayley
Super awesome sexy joebert cuddles though ����

12/12/2014 14:24:34

Me
Sleeping in front of the TV is pretty much the definition of quality family time :) Packing sucks, but Vienna will be totally worth it! Very jealous, really wish I was going.
And yeah, I totally get that :P But it's really unfair of you to be as hot as you are. Seriously, it's problematic. In tht case- snuggles while watching Hot Rod?? :D x

12/12/2014 14:30:54

Me
Oh, actually just remembered - I want to show you Hylands park

12/12/2014 15:04:45

Hayley
S'alright, I'm gonna pack the joebert way and just shove some stuff in a case :). 
I'd apologise, but... I'm not sorry. so... Yeh. Guess you're just gonna have to deal with it!
Is hot rod a euphemism for something else...? ;) but lol yeh. sounds good :). Park sounds cool too! Yayaaa see you in a bit.xx

12/12/2014 17:47:57

Me
Here :)

12/12/2014 17:50:20

Hayley

13/12/2014 17:34:06

Hayley

13/12/2014 18:10:32

Me
Hey Hayze :) No problem! Hope you have an amazing time. This has been an awesome week, I can't wait to see you again. For real. Have fun! �� x

13/12/2014 18:26:34

Hayley
Just on the plane. Will text you when I can. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!xxxx

16/12/2014 10:12:09

17/12/2014 12:36:35

17/12/2014 22:30:51

Me
My never-washed scarf :) I know. Hey, what should we actually do on Friday? X

17/12/2014 22:31:23

Me
Your scarf smells like you :)

17/12/2014 22:33:03

Me
I look very effeminate with my sparkly scarf and pink bag. Feeling pretty ��

17/12/2014 22:33:00

Hayley
Sex. Sex on Friday please.

17/12/2014 22:34:07

Hayley
Hehe yeh, that's why I like yours :):). Well you are very pretty!!! Thats why I want to have sex with you...

17/12/2014 22:36:26

Me
Those are the top two texts I've ever received

17/12/2014 22:37:24

Me
That plan works for me too actually, because I'd really like to have sex with you

17/12/2014 22:38:24

Me
I pretty much always want to have sex with you, to be honest

17/12/2014 22:39:39

Me
Thanks again for my presents! Really very kind :) and thoughtful to get something for my family, too ��

17/12/2014 22:40:57

17/12/2014 22:50:48

Hayley
But also, yeh there are options, we can go for dinner with my friends, or go for dinner on our own and then go back to mine, Or order something at mine. Or we can do an actual activity, but seeing as we got a packed weekend we might wanna just chill... ! :)

17/12/2014 22:54:17

Me
I want to eat out

17/12/2014 22:54:34

Me
������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

17/12/2014 22:55:38

Me
Or order something in. It's pretty much something at a restaurant near yours, or that, if you're cool with it?

17/12/2014 22:56:19

Me
Or dinner with your friends

17/12/2014 22:56:58

Me
But I'd prefer to spend it with you, given the choice ��

17/12/2014 23:01:00

Hayley
Looooooooooool!!! Was gonna send the winky faces if you didn't!! We can always eat something at home to save money too! Plenty of options! :)

17/12/2014 23:09:00

Hayley
Ewwww some guys just thrown up on the train!! And the trains completely packed! So much drama, some women is crying and everyone is trying to escape from it. and the man who did it keep going on about it , telling us what it consists of and saying "there's a lot of money down there" and then some woman pipes up from the back of the carriage " why don't you get off the train!' And everyone's like... yeh get off! It's funny when people on trains actually talk to one another!

17/12/2014 23:25:06

Me
Let's have something at yours :) that's actually hilarious!

17/12/2014 23:26:07

Me
Told my parents about that, they laughed too. But my Dad's said he wants none of your cake if it's stolen x

17/12/2014 23:29:25

Me
They say thank you, and they're really looking forward to Sunday :)

17/12/2014 23:37:05

Hayley
Ok! Spoke to the rents, dad said he'll cook for 5 and we can either eat with them or eat a bit later if we don't get back in time :). 
Haha, nice one papa H! Good joke :). And tell them they're most welcome ! Hope its nice!

17/12/2014 23:50:43

Me
That's really very kind of him! Please say thank you from me. :) 
I know, it's the most dad-joke dad-joke ever. 
Thank you again for all the presents! Very lucky to have such an awesome girlfriend. Looking forward to making it up to you. Gotta get some sleep now :( Really enjoyed tonight, can't wait for tomorrow(ish) now :D
Night Haze �� xox

17/12/2014 23:52:54

Hayley
He woulda cooked anyway so all good! Oh no please don't make it up to me, you've already done so much! Please just take it in good grace :). Yeahhhhy tomorrow. Night joebert!!!xx

18/12/2014 10:34:31

Hayley
Wearing your scarf again today :)

18/12/2014 12:57:00

Me
As am I :) Felt a bit like the pervy guy from Dickens Inn on the way into work, think I can see where he's coming from. How's today been? ��

18/12/2014 13:02:13

Hayley
Haha! But he was a stranger, he had no business sniffing your scarf!! I do find it oddly comforting though wearing it :):). Sbeen good! Went to the dentist this morning, now hanging out with sherese, we might do a bit of work together too. How're you? ��

18/12/2014 17:58:36

Me
Tis true, been a long old day, and it's nice to have another reminder of you for the way home :)
Oh yeah, how did it go at the dentists? Did you find out what the problem was?
I'm doing well, although today was a bit of a mad dash to get everything ready for our big investor show-off meeting tomorrow morning. We got everything working at 5.20, so fingers crossed it doesn't all explode :)
How'd the rest of your day go? Get much done with Sherese? ��

18/12/2014 18:00:31

Me
Oh, and have you got a plan for tomorrow evening? Wondering if I should come to yours alone rather than you come in to London? Xx

18/12/2014 18:31:51

Hayley
Hehe, I've been wearing it all day lol, felt like you were here with me, but then you weren't...  Dentists was fine, he out a bit of filler in but it's not quite even so now that's annoying me haha. But it's cool. Nicce!! Fingers crossed for no explosions :). Rest of the day was cool, I didn't get any work done but did some planning for sophages party (you should have a fb invite!). And I have a meeting tomorrow with my supervisor so will be in town anyway. we could meet at st Pancras? Whenever suits you :)

18/12/2014 19:11:17

Me
I know, but not long now :D Then it's pretty much a whole weekend together, too :)
Hopefully the tooth will smooth out a bit with time. Bit annoying for now though :(
Sophage's party!! Really want to hear the story from them now! Thanks for the invite. I'll keep the day free ��
Meeting at St Pancras works for me :) About 6 good for you? Spent pretty much all of today looking forward to it ���� x

18/12/2014 20:13:31

Hayley
Yeahhhhh! We're not 100% set on the date yet though, it's still tbc! Saaaffeee, 6 o'clock it is :):). Xxxx

18/12/2014 20:39:47

Me
So long as it's not a weekday, I'll be there :) If it is, I'll try to book it.
We just had the Stollen! My God, how expensive was that? My Grandad pointed out that the wooden box had dovetail joints. He's very impressed haha. Thanks Hayley!! Xx

18/12/2014 20:52:41

Hayley
Looking likely to be the Sunday, but it's not gonna be a late so don't worry! Lool!! The box was my favourite bit ! Hope you guys enjoyed it :)xx

18/12/2014 21:28:04

Me
I'll come either way :) might call in a little bit if it's alright? X

18/12/2014 21:35:15

Hayley
I'm out at jackys at the moment having tea so can't really chat :(:(

18/12/2014 21:36:03

Me
Ah no worries, nothing important. Have fun! :)

18/12/2014 21:36:31

Hayley
Was there something you wanted to talk about??x

18/12/2014 21:40:23

Me
Nah, just wanted to talk, but we'll have plenty of time for that tomorrow :) Enjoy the tea! X

18/12/2014 21:48:01

18/12/2014 22:14:54

Hayley

18/12/2014 22:22:15

Hayley
Pretty much the same reaction I had... Lol

18/12/2014 22:23:04

Me
Nods of approval? Tips? Variants? Big no-nos? :)

18/12/2014 22:23:26

Me
I'm too interested

18/12/2014 22:26:35

Hayley
Lol!! Just really don't understand all the grabbing and stretching...!

18/12/2014 22:40:36

Me
It does seem a bit extreme in the video...

18/12/2014 22:41:00

Me
Argh now I need to re-watch it

18/12/2014 23:02:09

Hayley
Nah its not really extreme... It just doesn't make much sense! Lool, you actually gonna?

18/12/2014 23:04:32

Me
I guess you gotta try most of it to see what works and doesn't. A lot of that seems to be about playing around :) Just about to go to my room. Hmmmmm

18/12/2014 23:05:12

Hayley
Thought you were gonna a get an early night...

18/12/2014 23:07:01

Hayley
Just got back myself :)

19/12/2014 08:11:31

Me
Good morning, Hayze! Hope you have a great day and as always, can't wait to see you later. Going to be a fun weekend :D x

19/12/2014 12:42:36

Hayley
Thanks joebert!! Days all changed, supervisor meeting got cancelled so went to the airport to drop sister instead. You still ok to get the train to mine on your own? I can meet you at the station :)

19/12/2014 13:17:41

Me
Ah, that's good! Got to spend a bit more time with her :) Did she get off ok? Yeah, sure, no problem x

19/12/2014 13:18:36

Me
Also, I should warn you, I do have a bit of a cough :(

19/12/2014 13:21:33

Hayley
Yeh, all good. although apparently today's the busiest day of the year at Heathrow! 
Noooo joebertt!! Eat all the strepsils! Feel better xx

19/12/2014 15:00:13

Hayley
Also, please let me know what train you get so that I know when to expect you :). And you're probs better off getting the train from farringdon, not kings cross! At farringdon you only need to go up and over but at kings cross you need to walk for a million years!!

19/12/2014 16:33:08

Me
Glad it went well :) I'm fine really, it's more annoying than anything else.
Thanks for the tip! I'll let you know when I'm sat on a train. Am I going to Edgware or Mill Hill Broadway? :)
Oh, and by the way, you're unbelievably hot. Just so you know. X

19/12/2014 16:35:28

Hayley
mill hill Broadway! Gotta get the actual train from Farringdon, not the tube. the train will be to st Albans or Bedford, but they don't all stop at mill hill so be careful!!

19/12/2014 16:35:49

Hayley
And Thanks :) so are you ��

19/12/2014 16:51:59

Hayley
Also, I hope you like Apple crumble...

19/12/2014 17:37:49

Me
On a train now :)

19/12/2014 17:44:35

Me
It's to Luton. Love apple crumble :) Please pass on another thank you from me! See you soon x

19/12/2014 17:38:53

Hayley
Wooo. What time does it come in?

19/12/2014 17:50:28

Hayley
Where you at now? I'll come pick you up :)

19/12/2014 17:51:36

Me
Just left West Hempstead Thameslink x

19/12/2014 17:51:39

Me
Thanks :)

19/12/2014 17:57:16

Me
Is that even a place? Sounds like a train line. Anyways, leaving Hendon x

19/12/2014 18:01:38

Hayley
It's both lol! Waiting at mill hill :) wearing pjs so have to wait in the car!

21/12/2014 18:41:02

Me
My mum just said how lovely you are :) Couldn't agree more.
Thanks for coming along today! Even though it was a bit sedate, I still really enjoyed it, and everyone kept telling me how nice (and good looking) you are.
I'm so glad we got to spend this weekend like we did. I'm really very lucky to have you in my life. Let me know when you get home safe! 
Love you x

21/12/2014 18:51:43

Hayley
:):):):):):):):):):):):)
Aw thats really cool, glad people didn't think i was a retard! This weekend was literally awesome, and today was really lovely to meet (some of) your family!
Will do, and love you too ��
Btw I just did a little dance on the train seeing it written down like that ����

21/12/2014 19:16:50

Me
Of course not! My parents seriously haven't stopped telling me how great you are :)
I know, right? I'll call tonight so I can say it again �� :D x

21/12/2014 19:19:11

Hayley
Aww thats so awesome :). I really like them too. looking forward to getting to know them better!
Woo, I was hoping you would !! Not sick of me yet then eh? ��������

21/12/2014 19:55:00

Me
I'm really glad! They can't wait :)
Hells no! �� I'll call at about 9?? X

21/12/2014 19:55:59

Me
Ybybybybybybybybyb x

21/12/2014 19:59:05

Me
And I found out what was up with Kevin's eye, it was a contact lens :)

21/12/2014 20:00:58

Hayley
9 works :):). Looooool!!! You're rapidly becoming one of us !! :) . Ahhh right! Random though. Gonna send you the pics from Yday btw.x

21/12/2014 20:12:08

Hayley
Also, my mum said you're cute :)

21/12/2014 20:13:21

Me
Those pictures! X

21/12/2014 20:13:48

Me
Haha please thank her! And again for having me :)

21/12/2014 20:15:10

Hayley
She said you're more than welcome and that they'll be more talkative next time. They were really tired.x

21/12/2014 20:19:42

Me
Aww thanks. Hope your mum's back gets a bit better too :)

21/12/2014 20:45:10

Hayley
Thanks :). We forgot to eat the crumble again!

22/12/2014 09:53:24

Hayley
Morning Joe ��. Had a bad dream last night, must have been cos you weren't there with me :( Hope you have a good day today though, looking forward to tomorrow!xxx

22/12/2014 10:26:41

Hayley
Just got a minor electric shock... Feeling more awake now haha! (I'm fine don't worry!)xx

22/12/2014 12:48:54

Me
Hey Hayley �� Sorry to hear that! What happened in the dream? I'll be back soon to fend off any baddies :) 
And whaaa? an electric shock? Was it from the shower? Sounds like it might need a proper electrician to look at it :( 
Hope you're okay!
Still thinking we should meet at Temple tomorrow? Had a bit of a spring in my step all day today �� x

22/12/2014 13:02:02

Me
Been able to get much done today? :)

22/12/2014 13:21:30

Hayley
I dreamt that I had a whole bunch of exams in January that I hadn't starting revising for yet, and in was sooo stressed and upset, it was awful lol. Yayaya can't wait ! Nah it was from a plug ... Touched the metal bit like an idiot. Ah, well, I'm ok don't worry! Yepp temple :):) what time again? 6? 
Hehe my step is always springy! Lol yeh relatively productive , no work done but am spending time with Sophage so much more important :):):)

22/12/2014 16:15:37

Hayley
Hahaa turns out Sophage had the exact same dream a couple of days ago!!! Crazy!

22/12/2014 16:15:41

Hayley
Hahaa turns out Sophage had the exact same dream a couple of days ago!!! Crazy!

22/12/2014 18:09:12

Me
That sucks! At least it's not true! :) and how strange that Sophage had the same one... Those dreams must haunt ex-students for ages. Do you have actually any exams like that for the EngD?? Thought it was all research-focused...
Glad you weren't also electrocuted! Bit of a traumatic morning, by the sounds of it! Glad you're okay ��
Yeah, 6 would be great for me. Really can't wait now!
Glad you're getting to spend some time on the things that matter :)

22/12/2014 18:12:07

Me
This scarf may be the single most comfortable thing I've worn. It's like a fabric hug. Sorry, Hayley, I might end up stealing it for a bit longer... :)
And yay iced and spiced ��

22/12/2014 18:54:42

Hayley
Eugh I hope I never have that dream again. it's literally the worst! I might have to do an exam or two for the taught modules, but will do my best to avoid them! I Fucking HATE exams!
Anywayyy, cooool beaannnsss, 6 it is!! Hehe yeh, its been a great day, we had tea, went and got our nails done, and then went for tea again :):) !!
Lol thats fine, truthfully I don't really intend on ever returning yours, except for you to wear it for a bit so it becomes more joebert-y and then steal it back later :). Hehe. Xxx

22/12/2014 20:22:43

Me
Haha I get the impression! Sounds really shitty :( 
But thankfully, it's not real, so you can enjoy Christmas and New Years properly! You'll blow the real ones away, no worries ��
Today sounds like it's been awesome. I'm beginning to somewhat suspect that you and Sophage might quite like tea. Just a hunch �� I've been drinking green tea all God-damn day.
Sounds like it's only fair! May have to get you to wear yours while I'm over, too. How delightfully creepy of us both xx

22/12/2014 20:27:28

Me
The chocolates you bought me from Vienna are actually alcoholic! Think I'll save the rest for the weekend :)

22/12/2014 21:51:05

Hayley
Yeh it was really nice! Just back from anniversary dinner with my parents, was cool getting all the juice about when they got together and their wedding etc! 
Lol, your hunch may infact be correct! Pahaha hot rod reference, hilar! 
Lol yes, delightful! Although yours is itching me a bit now so might actually be due for a wash...
Loool really??? Thats jokes! We're they nice at least?x

22/12/2014 22:20:00

Me
Oh awesome! I wanna hear the stories :) Always enjoy hearing from my parents about their beginnings. Apparently my mum (wrongly!) thought my dad would be a dickhead. Weird hearing that from the people that raised you ��
You'll have to fill me in tomorrow!
Yeah, I really should have stolen it back for a bit to do that! Feel a bit bad and gross now. Sorry! Haha
The chocolates are fab, just don't really want to be getting tipsy when it's both a school night and you're not here :( They'll be perfect for watching a movie in an evening though! Speaking of which, should I bring anything on a USB? Could bring Lord of The Rings? Tangled? The Grinch?...

*whispers barely audibly*
Indiana Jones?

22/12/2014 22:59:27

Hayley
❤❤❤❤❤❤

22/12/2014 23:18:33

Me
Night Hayley ����❤️

23/12/2014 08:25:33

Me
Goooooood Morning :) Looking forward to seeing you tonight �� x

23/12/2014 09:25:51

Me
I was very tempted to send a picture of my shoulders this morning, still going strong ��

23/12/2014 09:39:38

Hayley
Morning joebear! Really looking forward to it too :):). 
Loool no way?! I can top them up tonight if you like ;);).
Had another dodgy dream last night :(, actually woke up, put the light on and then went back to sleep lol. Dunno whats going on with my brain atm!x

23/12/2014 13:23:30

Me
Yes. Yes please :D
Jeez, another one? What was this one about?? Surely at some point you'll run out of new nightmares to have, so you'll just get really good at dealing with the older ones in-dream :) x

23/12/2014 13:33:00

Hayley
Hehe! 
Yer... It was super weird, started of pretty cool and then took a dark turn, will fill you in later!
Haha let's hope so. They're not too bad though, more just weird dreams with slightly upsetting elements that full blown nightmares!xx

23/12/2014 17:39:52

Me
I might be 5 min late, sorry, on way! :)

23/12/2014 17:42:12

Hayley
You suuck! See you in a bit.xx

23/12/2014 17:46:09

Me
Not only that, but I'm a bit ill, and the next circle line is 5 mins from now. Dayummmmm

23/12/2014 17:46:44

Me
I wanna hear about the dream :)

23/12/2014 17:47:13

Me
Be there soon. Sorry ��

23/12/2014 17:54:08

Hayley
Lol don't worry. Hope you feel better x

24/12/2014 18:40:04

Me
Just took the card out again :) Thanks so much! It means a lot to me. Looking forward to the rest of the story ��
And my Christmas present yesterday was awesome! So glad we got to do that together :)
Can't wait to have a proper fake Christmas soon. 
Love you, Hayley ��

24/12/2014 18:40:10

Hayley
Driving down to Bournemouth tonight fyi. Hope the journey to weybridge went ok :)xx

24/12/2014 20:59:03

Me
Thanks, same to you! Getting a head start? :) Have fun with the family tree. Journey went well, just finished wrapping presents and now sat with the parents and Jonny watching telly and being force-fed chocolate ��
Off to a good start already haha. Drive safe! ��

24/12/2014 23:29:30

Hayley
Yeh something like that, just made sense to go tonight, that way maybe I can come back on Friday :). Sounds good :). Hope you've had a nice evening! Xxx

25/12/2014 09:46:29

Me
Merry Christmas!! ��������������

25/12/2014 09:51:22

25/12/2014 10:35:28

Hayley
Merry Christmas my Love!!! ������������ all good :). Have an awesome day! Nice and sunny down here... Not particularly Christmassy!

25/12/2014 13:35:31

Hayley
Hope all is going well sexy babes :). (?! Does that work...? Lol!) Just wondering what time you'll be heading back tomorrow? :)

25/12/2014 13:51:24

Hayley
Btw, don't worry about not being able to reply, I know you're busy doing Christmas stuff ��������. Just whenevs. ��������.x

25/12/2014 14:03:41

Me
It's going really well, but wish you were here too :( 
We've had a HUGE breakfast, just finished exchanging presents and now preparing dinner :D How's yours been going? ��
Not sure about when yet, but I'd imagine we'd leave around 4ish (but I'll let you know when I do!)
Miss you! �� x

25/12/2014 14:05:44

Me
Been up to much Christmassy stuff so far? ��

25/12/2014 14:21:17

Me
...Oh and thanks for being so understanding :) x

25/12/2014 15:29:24

Hayley
Yay sounds awesome :):):). Get any actual presents in the end? It's all going ok, absolutely nothing christmassy going on at all, just another day here! 
Right ok, just asking cos I might be coming back tomorrow instead ;). We'll see if that'd actually work out though!

25/12/2014 15:57:47

Hayley
I showed my aunt a picture of us (the one you said was your favourite) and she said you looked really sweet and that you had really kind eyes and that we have her blessing (which means a lot considering you're not Jewish!!). Also everyone said that we really suit and that actually we look quite similar! Lol!. Xx

25/12/2014 16:49:11

Me
I did, actually :) Lots of chocolate, a couple of nice shirts and plenty of biscuity nutty snacky stuff. Tomorrow would be awesome if it does work! Keep me posted ;)
Aww that's really sweet! Glad to hear it :) :) Funny enough, we had a family face-time with my aunt (Kate, on my Dad's side, who has ME) earlier on, she wanted to hear all about you and my family were quick to fill her in :)
Just about to have Christmas dinner, hope you're having something nice too ��

25/12/2014 17:07:53

Hayley
Oh nice :). Will do! Might not leave until after dinner though, we'll have to figure out timings etc! 
Hehe that's cool!! :)
We had a really nice lunch before, not a Christmas lunch as such, but it was yuuuuummmmy! I just wanna stuff my face with chocolate though...!xxx

25/12/2014 19:38:39

Me
Oop - timings just got a little trickier, think we'll be leaving just after lunch. No rush on you getting back, though, just let me know when you're thinking and I'll make my way to ya :)
Go for it! Today's definitely the day for guilt-free chocolately gluttony ��
We're all stuffed now, getting the Christmas phone calls from all the relatives. Usually about 15 people on each call, so it's quite fun :) Hope Xmas evening's going well, really can't wait to see you again ����x

25/12/2014 21:00:11

Hayley
Ah ok! Seems silly cos weybridge is kinda on my way home, but eh well. You probs want some time at home to sort yourself out anyway! 
Haha yeh I have done, don't even have space for dinner cos of all the crap! Lol sounds nice :). 
Yeh s'gone well, we watched Miranda and then played some cards. they're gonna watch downtown now so I think I'm gonna have a nice bath. shame you're not here to join me... Can't wait to see you either! Love you <3. Xx

25/12/2014 23:33:10

Me
Hmm yeah, I know what you mean. Plus it does mean longer before we see each other... :(
Ah well. I'll keep you posted if the plan changes at all though!
Aww that sounds like it's been a really nice day with the family :)
Man I wish I was there for the bath. Long weekend ahead though ;)
Lots of London landmarks have popped up on TV and in conversation today, and each one just happened to be a place we'd been to. Happy memories :) Love you too x

25/12/2014 23:35:29

Me
Just about wrapping up (groan) Christmas now. How'd the last of yours go? X

25/12/2014 23:37:46

Me
Oh, and I added you on Snapchat earlier :)

25/12/2014 23:45:44

Hayley
Yeh sbeen a good day, didn't have to get dressed at all, perfect :). Aww that's so cool!!! We still got plenty more to visit though :). Well you can look forward to another mini Christmas on the weekend! All gone well,  watching a movie now with my aunt and then bed time I guess. Oooooh, I'll accept you, how exciting!x

26/12/2014 00:19:57

Thinking of making a bit of a change to my plans so I'd be staying here in Weybridge. Would you be able to come by this way when you've finished later on, please? �� xx

26/12/2014 10:52:48

Hayley
No problem in principle :). But fyi my cousin is gonna be in the car with me! We're working under the proviso that we're gonna have early dinner and then leave after that, so probs wont get to you much before 9... Would that be ok?x

26/12/2014 11:20:08

Me
That would be fan-dabby-dozey with me, if that's cool? Thanks Hayley! �� x

26/12/2014 11:23:03

Me
Hope you have a good Boxing Day. Can't wait to see you :) xx

26/12/2014 15:05:15

Me
Will do! Thanks again for doing this, Hayley :) xx

26/12/2014 15:07:48

26/12/2014 19:10:22

Me

26/12/2014 19:18:48

Hayley
...dunnoo... Not sure my cousin would want to tbh and I can't really leave her in the car...

26/12/2014 19:21:50

Me
No problemmo �� My aunt may come out and do an embarrassing little wave, just so you know. See you soon! X

26/12/2014 19:28:44

Hayley
Lol cool! Leaving now.x

28/12/2014 21:08:48

Me
Going to the loo too x

29/12/2014 12:51:44

Hayley
Cool beans :)

30/12/2014 08:50:22

Hayley
Made it in, super weird, I think I'm the only person on campus...

30/12/2014 09:00:11

Hayley
Also, it a freezing!!! No heating....

30/12/2014 09:03:33

Me
The most dedicated person on campus! Also most smart, most pretty, most everything really x

30/12/2014 09:03:42

Me
Wrap up warm! Xx

30/12/2014 09:06:12

Hayley
Aw thanks :). Someone just came into the office and it scared the shit out of me!! Have a good day bebe.x

30/12/2014 12:41:57

Me
Yeah, but you were also the only one, so you'd be the most of any category going, really. Good thing those things are true anyway :)

30/12/2014 12:42:12

Me
Getting much work done? X

30/12/2014 13:09:34

Hayley
Lol! Yer its going ok!! Gonna do a little bit more and then gonna meet Alice for tea!! She's coming into central today and I haven't seen her for ageeeeess so it's worked out well :):). How're things going your end?x

30/12/2014 16:09:45

Hayley
Fyi I'm meeting my friends at Harvester at 5.30! Let me know what your plans are re coming home.x

30/12/2014 17:40:26

Me
Just finished :) That's cool about Alice earlier, how'd it go? (and remind me again, is she a uni friend?)
Work was as about as I'd imagined. Bah. Over now :)
No answer about what's happening with that yet but seems pretty obvious at this point.
Hope you're having fun with your friends! I might sneak by to borrow the key/ be let in, I found out today that I can't not shower every day �� Sam actually said "You could fry chips in that hair". Cheers, bud.
See you soon x

30/12/2014 17:54:30

Hayley
It went cool!! Was lovely to see her :) yep, maths buddy :). Sure thang!! Let me know when you'll be by! Loool, I'm sure it wasn't that bad!

30/12/2014 18:31:21

Me
Just leaving Mill Hill station :)

30/12/2014 18:32:11

Hayley
Cool, we're in harvester, you wanna come in and say hi? I can give you the keys.

30/12/2014 18:36:01

Me
Can do, but I am a sweaty mess right now haja

30/12/2014 18:36:35

Hayley
Up to you :)

30/12/2014 18:37:58

Me
I'd like to meet everyone, but perhaps with a differen first impression, if that's alright :)

30/12/2014 18:39:36

Hayley
My friends would really like to meet you!! It'll only be brief :)

30/12/2014 18:40:29

Me
Cool beans, be right there :)

30/12/2014 19:31:49

Hayley
Coming home in a bit. Btw eat whatever you want if you're hungry!

30/12/2014 19:40:09

Me
Grand :) Thanks Haze ��

31/12/2014 08:04:13

Me
Doors just closed in front of me :( Ah well, at least I'm a bit toasty now, eh? 
Thanks again for everything Hayley, this was fun! Hope you have a great NYE (shame about the midnight kiss) and can't wait to see you next year. Love you ��

31/12/2014 10:17:04

Hayley
Ah no! Hope you weren't late for work? No need to thank me, I had the best time!! New year's is gonna be cool and we can have the kiss in spirit ! See you next year, love you too

31/12/2014 10:17:12

Hayley
❤❤❤

31/12/2014 12:06:34

Hayley
Whatever you may think I meant every word I said yesterday.xx

31/12/2014 14:40:27

Me
Still got in with time to spare this morning :) 
That really means a lot to me, Hayley. Of course every word is as true from me to you as well. Thanks for sending the song ☺️ x

31/12/2014 16:47:46

Me
Was something happening on the 10th? My family have asked if I can be home that weekend (they're away and need someone to watch the dog). Up for keeping me company? X

31/12/2014 18:54:04

Hayley
No idea about the 10th... And YES!

31/12/2014 22:16:48

Me
Awesome :) Can't wait. Hope you're having a great time ��
Going to text now just in case before the rush!
Thanks again for everything, Hayley. You're amazing, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life. Happy New Year! Here's to the next ���� xx

31/12/2014 22:19:59

Me
Love you �� x

31/12/2014 22:36:07

Hayley
Yeh all going well thanks :). Hope yours is going great too! Looking forward to hearing all about it :). I'm the lucky one!!!! Love you too ������. Happiest of new years to you too! Yes, here's to the next!!!xxx

01/01/2015 00:03:38

Hayley
Happy New year ;) xxx

01/01/2015 01:53:50

Me
Happy New Year! Wish I was there. See you soon �� x

01/01/2015 02:09:09

Hayley
Wish you were here too! Hope you had an awesome night joebert :). ❤��������.xxx

01/01/2015 10:18:16

Hayley
Morning Joe!! Hope you slept ok and not too hungover ? Did you have a good night? :) x

01/01/2015 10:59:24

Me
Morning :) All good here, just came back from breakfast with the family. Last night was fun! Got to catch up and be a bit silly with some old friends :) Still though, missed you a lot.
How was your party? ��Hope you're doing okay today! X

01/01/2015 11:49:29

Hayley
I fell back to sleep... Think it might actually be time to get up now! Ooh thats cool, sounds like a great night :):). Not sure it was a party here... Just three of us, but there was good and drink, was fun! But I got tired really early and then had to pretend to be in the party spirit for the sake of my guests... Had a good enough time though :). X

01/01/2015 12:51:32

Hayley
Hows your day today shaping up?x

01/01/2015 13:21:27

Me
Aww man, three guests? I shoulda figured summat out. Ah well. Glad it went well! Hope you're not feeling too sleepy now ;)
Today's been good so far, mostly spent it with the family. Just finished up getting a collage and a few photos printed up for my Grandad, and all back to normal now. How about yours? ��

01/01/2015 13:52:44

Hayley
Just two guests and me, you knew that!! Don't worry though it worked out well enough :). Nah feeling all good, pancake breakfast woo!! Aww nice, that's so cool! What's that for? Or something nice for you gdad? Back to normal? So you're just chilling? I wanna come chill with you :(. My days looking ok, hanging and chatting with Jacky atm, sherese went home a while ago. Might do some work later but might not. Who knows!!x

01/01/2015 14:20:08

Me
Then come! Come over. Come over please :)
Ah, I thought... that they were the only definite folks. Glad it was still good though!
So like I was saying before, come over please x
The collage was made up of photos taken of my Gran in her bed and at her funeral. Seems a little morbid for the medium of collage, but that's what he wanted, so there we go ��
Have fun with Jacky! But then when you're not, maybe come to Chelmsford? Up to you. Your choice. But choose to hang out xoxox

01/01/2015 14:21:43

Me
Or alternatively, we could be sensible, wait just a little longer and see each other tomorrow after work :)

01/01/2015 14:24:15

Me
OH MY GOD PEANUT BUTTER M&MS

01/01/2015 14:29:18

Hayley
Oh you, I've no idea - will see how the land lies when Jacky leaves in a bit! Also, not sure how tomorrow would work - need to check what the plans with Alice and ariane are!
And yes! Peanut butter m&ms!!

01/01/2015 14:41:19

Me
Haha! I'm being absurd ��
Sure, just remind me what's up, because the brain-seive's a bit leaky atm xx

01/01/2015 14:50:42

Hayley
Its not absurd at all! I'd love to come and see you! Just thinking about timings and whether it's possible..! 
Ariane is my French friend who is on town this week, gotta see her tomorrow and then we might be meeting up with others I'm the evening...! Will let you know :)

01/01/2015 15:43:17

Hayley
On my way.x

01/01/2015 15:44:05

Me
Awesome! Can't wait to see you �� x

01/01/2015 16:28:44

Hayley
I'm here :)

02/01/2015 08:28:09

Me
Thanks for being a little bit ridiculous with me. As always, had an awesome time with you, even though we didn't have all that long. Hope your drive home goes well and that working today isn't too bad!
Can't wait to see you later on, have fun with Alice and Ariane :) I'm really very lucky to know you, Hayley. Love you �� x

02/01/2015 08:29:03

Me
And thanks for the lift this morning! X

02/01/2015 08:55:28

Hayley

02/01/2015 18:23:44

Hayley

02/01/2015 18:23:50

Hayley
On a bus! Be there in 10.x

02/01/2015 18:24:19

Me
See you soon x

02/01/2015 18:26:48

Hayley
Where abouts are you waiting?

02/01/2015 18:27:31

Me
Just by the underground station. Do you know where the stop is? X

02/01/2015 18:28:08

Hayley
Just looking!!

02/01/2015 18:30:07

Me
Walking allot bow street to meet you :)

02/01/2015 18:32:05

Hayley
There's a bar called Maxwell's near the station, just walk towards Covent garden a bit and you'll see it on the left. Wanna meet us there? If you want you can go into the bar and get us a table (in the bar upstairs) :). No worries if you would rather just wait!

02/01/2015 18:32:57

Me
I'll give it a go :) see you soon x

02/01/2015 18:34:28

Me
How many people?

03/01/2015 20:08:12

Hayley
2 mins!!

03/01/2015 20:08:38

Me
No worries, G, long as you need :)

03/01/2015 21:00:50

Me
I have a great idea!!!!

03/01/2015 21:01:15

Hayley
... Yes?

03/01/2015 21:02:03

Me
This is exactly what happens in bathrooms. Eureka! Suddenly everything makes sense!

03/01/2015 21:02:35

Hayley
...YES?!

03/01/2015 21:03:44

Me
Bathrooms force you to fully confront reality, one way or another, and carry supernatural problem-crushing auras x

03/01/2015 21:04:09

Hayley
-_-

05/01/2015 08:46:36

Me
Miss you already :( Have a good day! X

05/01/2015 08:51:11

Hayley
Aw you're so cute ����. Miss you too! See you soon though :)

05/01/2015 18:27:50

Me
Haha! Thanks for the song (and title clarification) ��
Hope the transition back went well xx

05/01/2015 18:32:24

Hayley
Was literally typing that out when you texted!x

05/01/2015 18:32:32

Hayley
Day one of 1,095 : Already questioning why I'm doing a PhD... Hope your day went weller :)

05/01/2015 18:38:47

Me
Cut out, but had to get off the train anyways :/ Probably speak later :)

05/01/2015 18:40:01

Hayley
No worries I figured :). Would like that if possible :):).xx

05/01/2015 19:38:45

Hayley
Lol paper clip dude. He looked bare excited!

Hayley
Morning joebert! I was really sick last night and have had to try and sleep it off this morning. Heading into uni in a bit - but will have to let you know about meeting up later. Might be best for me to head home and rest :(. Xx

06/01/2015 10:03:29

Me
Morning! Oh no! Sorry to hear that :( no worries about later on, getting better's the most important thing! Hope you're not feeling too rough �� xx

06/01/2015 10:18:02

Hayley
Thanks joebert! I think it might even be a bad idea to head into town, but I've left my laptop at uni... grr. Will see how I feel later on! Thanks for understanding.xx

06/01/2015 14:06:01

Hayley
It's not looking good joebert - did a couple hours work and now feel even worse. Back in bed but can't stop shivering! Gonna try and get some sleep. But I won't be able to see you tonight :(:( sorry xxxx

06/01/2015 17:59:01

Me
Noooo!! That sucks, feel better soon! Hopefully you've been able to get some sleep? Let me know if you feel up to a quick call later on �� xx

06/01/2015 18:14:36

Hayley
Thanks joebert. Yeh I had a bit of a sleep, still not feeling to great though :(. Really hoping an early night will set me right for tomorrow. Would love to talk in the phone later :), although I'm not sure I'll be great conversation.xx

06/01/2015 18:31:31

Me
Fingers crossed you do! I'll be happy to just hear your voice :) Take it easy Xox

06/01/2015 19:08:18

Hayley
Btw, do you remember when I told you about the retarded/moany/depressed phase I would probably go through at the start of this year... I can only apologise x

06/01/2015 19:52:34

Me
Haha! Don't worry about it :) I'll call about 9.30? X

06/01/2015 19:56:21

Hayley
Might be asleep by then, but sure :)

06/01/2015 20:03:07

Me
Got a couple minutes now, if you're up for a good rant? :)

06/01/2015 20:11:19

Hayley
Sorry just eating dinner. You're busy later?x

06/01/2015 20:17:47

Me
Ah gotcha. Nope, just eating too now x

06/01/2015 20:33:24

Hayley
Ok - call when you can.xx

07/01/2015 08:05:40

Me
Morning! Hope you're feeling a bit better than yesterday xx

07/01/2015 08:56:47

Me
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

07/01/2015 08:59:16

Hayley
Morning joebert! Might be a bit better thanks, although still feeling super rough :(:(. Hope you have a good day.xx

07/01/2015 10:46:49

Me
At least that's something! :) Same to you xx

07/01/2015 12:38:59

Me
Though I imagine you'll be spending it all in bed ☺️

07/01/2015 13:28:41

Hayley
Yup, only been out of bed to go to the bathroom. I keep stressing myself out about work, I need to relax though otherwise i'll never get better :(

07/01/2015 13:29:34

Hayley
Is it bad that I haven't eaten anything but I'm not even hungry...?

07/01/2015 16:08:39

Hayley
I've since eaten. Don't worry x

07/01/2015 18:28:57

Me
Stress is a bit like bacteria.
As we all know from the yakult adverts, there's actually two kinds of bacteria, not loads like all those scientists say, and they are neatly categorised as good bacteria and bad bacteria.
The same distinction applies to stress. Good stress keeps us alert and awake, so that we can fend off pesky tigers and stuff. But bad stress has the opposite effect, it makes us worry, get sick and that means no work or seeing Joeberts, which makes meeting your RDJA (Recommended Daily Joebert Allowance) very difficult, along with increasing your chances of developing a JTJIGOSUP deficiency. (Joe This Joke Is Getting Old Shut Up Please)

What the hell did I just type

07/01/2015 18:31:45

Hayley
IRMYAIATIMMFW (I Really Miss You And Its Actually Making Me Feel Worse).

07/01/2015 18:31:57

Me
Yeah... Long day, brain's being a bit weird. Hope you're feeling a bit better! Glad you were able to eat. Don't worry about work! It's all going to get done, you're going to be amazing and anything that makes you think otherwise simply isn't true. You're awesome. So rest up, don't worry about needing to take time to recover, and you'll be able to actually blow the work away once you're back and ready :)

07/01/2015 18:32:38

Hayley
Btw that text was so cute it actually made me cry.x

07/01/2015 18:34:00

Hayley
Thanks joebert :). I don't know why you have so much confidence in me but it's encouraging, really appreciate it!xxx

07/01/2015 18:35:01

Hayley
Why's brain being a bit weird?x

07/01/2015 18:48:59

Me
Because you're you. 
Just let yourself be ill for a bit, leave worrying about stuff for later. There's definitely going to be times in the future when a bit of stressing might actually do some good, but it's not now. Chillax. It's all going to be okay :)
Brain's a bit sleepy from work, I think that's why I started texting you about Yakult. Hope eating's helped xx

07/01/2015 19:12:45

Hayley
Thanks joebert. You're right. I was wondering today why i felt extra crappy and I think it's probably because I'm missing you quite a lot :(. I'm not sure what's gonna happen over the weekend anymore because of work etc, but as soon as I'm better I need to see your face!! Also, time for a call later?x

07/01/2015 20:16:20

Me
Aww. Sure xx

07/01/2015 21:20:08

Hayley
Just gonna check on my sis. 2 secs.,lx

07/01/2015 21:23:14

Let me know when you're back x

07/01/2015 23:16:38

Hayley
❤��❤��❤

07/01/2015 23:22:14

Me
����❤️ Thanks Hayley. It's fine really, just know what's happening now. Worked out a bit of a plan for tomorrow morning too, so should be sorted. Hope you're feeling well too! Are you taking the paracetamol or just going straight to sleep? Xx

07/01/2015 23:23:42

Hayley
Plan for tomorrow morning??
I've a sneaky plan to wait until midnight and then I can take them guilt free :). Might pass out a bit earlier though lol!x

07/01/2015 23:28:17

Me
Just to confirm everything and get stuff sorted if I am going. You can take them now :) Don't worry about it, it'll definitely be fine. And I'm not just saying that ;) Can't wait to see you, Hayley. Miss you. Night ❤️ x

07/01/2015 23:29:27

Hayley
Miss you so much too. ❤ Love you ❤. Sleep well.xxx

08/01/2015 09:53:49

Me
Morning! Hope you're feeling a bit better today :)
Just spoke to my boss. He said that the paperwork to renew is in the works, although that refers to getting a consultant with FDM, not specifically me. But for now, it seems I'm staying :) He also said that he had seen significant improvement in my work, and that he is no longer my line manager. Phew.
Can't wait to see you xx

08/01/2015 10:32:13

Hayley
Morning joebert! Just woke up, not quite sure how I feel yet, but groggy but could just be waking up still. 
That's great news!!! Yay! You must be so relieved! Awesome about him not being your line manager anymore! How did that happen?xx

08/01/2015 14:59:03

Hayley
Hey joebert. I'm gonna shower and get ready and try and go into uni to get my laptop, my friend is ill so there is no way of you picking it up for me. If I manage to get in and don't feel to rough maybe we can meet for a quick tea after you finish work? I might be being too optimistic, but we will see.x

08/01/2015 16:22:48

Me
I'd love that! Hope you are feeling a bit better, maybe see you soon ��❤️ xx

08/01/2015 16:23:43

Me
Let me know where to meet you if you are up to it :)

08/01/2015 16:26:39

Hayley
I'm dressed and about to leave the house!! If possible could you meet me at euston square? As early as you can if poss :)

08/01/2015 16:35:35

Hayley
Yayayayayyyyyy. Do you remember the directions I gave you to come to my uni? Or should I meet you at the station?x

08/01/2015 17:41:19

Me
Stay warm and comfy! And maybe text me the directions... ��

08/01/2015 17:43:57

Hayley
Lol ok! Go out of euston sq station, turn left down Gower street and its about 100 yards down on your left. there'll be a big quad with a builinng with lit up columns. I'm the first building on the right when you walk in (Chadwick). Meet you at the gates. Text me when you're out the station :)x

08/01/2015 17:58:57

Me
Same, it's pretty strange x

08/01/2015 22:07:24

Me
Great to half-see you! Sorry I could only bring half of me along :( The other half is going to be very jealous. Let me know that you're home safe �� x

08/01/2015 22:02:47

Hayley
It's not strange, it's part of you so it's beautiful! 
Get on the train ok?x

08/01/2015 22:11:47

Hayley
I'm so happy I got to see you, half, full or otherwise!!! Will do. Hope I didn't keep you out too late xx

08/01/2015 22:20:01

Me
And you really are. When we're together, it keeps coming back and hits me every now and then.
Really sorry you're still ill. Fingers crossed for the weekend. And I hope I didn't keep you out too long! On the train back now, shouldn't be that late. Are you nearly at Mill Hill? X

08/01/2015 22:27:59

Hayley
I really am what?? 
Yeh just got in, have to change my sheets booo but then bed yay! I forgot I have a really early doctors appointment tomorrow... Glad we left when we did! Please let me know when you get home!xxx

08/01/2015 23:13:12

Hayley
I gotta go to sleep now, hope you got back ok. Sleep well xxxxxx

08/01/2015 23:14:22

09/01/2015 08:29:28

Me
That really is an early appointment! Let me know how it goes :) Glad you're feeling a bit better too. Slept well, thanks. Think I was a bit paranoid about being I'll this morning but seems to have passed. Hope you did too x

09/01/2015 08:34:33

Hayley
Been waiting 20 mins! Thinking of just leaving this is stupid! Ffs! Lol no way! I really hope you're not ill, I'd feel so bad, you sure you're ok?xx

09/01/2015 08:42:14

Me
No question, waiting for doctors sucks. It's not odd to wait for 40 at mine :(
Don't worry! I'm really not ill, just felt a bit naff earlier. All good now :)

09/01/2015 08:49:49

Hayley
Lol, the doctor was ill too with the same thing!   Lots of it going around. he gave the a doctor's note though in case I can't make the presentation on Tuesday and told me to take vitamin c etc. Heading home to rest a bit then will try working a bit later. Have a good day joebert.xx

09/01/2015 09:00:34

Me
Well that's good :) Think that's a sensible plan. Same to you, Haze ��

Hey joebert, hope you've made a good morning. I'm really not sure about how things are gonna work this weekend... But I really really wanna see you!! I don't think it's a good idea to stay over, but maybe I can come For a visit on Saturday or something?x

09/01/2015 16:46:34

Hayley
Call/text me when you finish work :):)

09/01/2015 17:04:35

09/01/2015 18:23:04

Hayley
Well yeh, I'm excited about my life decision :) (which want quite been fully made yet...). And also I get to see you tomorrow wooooo!.xx

09/01/2015 18:27:36

Hayley
*hasn't

09/01/2015 18:27:46

Me
I'm so intrigued! What could it be? You're going vegetarian? Converting to Rastafarianism? Joining a travelling circus?

09/01/2015 18:28:02

Me
Woo can't wait :D xx

09/01/2015 18:28:30

Me
I'll figure out what's for dinner ;)

09/01/2015 18:29:34

Hayley
None of the above, it's work related, and not all that exciting tbh don't worry!
Yaya! Something healthy please :)

09/01/2015 20:08:48

Hayley
2 mins.x

09/01/2015 20:09:04

Me
No worries :)

09/01/2015 21:34:03

Me
Really excited for you :D x

09/01/2015 21:35:46

Hayley
Thanks joebert :) really appreciate the support !!

09/01/2015 21:36:16

Hayley
You're the best.x

09/01/2015 21:41:37

Me
You're joint-best. We're both equally the best :) x

09/01/2015 21:42:20

Hayley
Yb :):):)

09/01/2015 21:42:59

Hayley
Nice dinner? :)

09/01/2015 21:51:47

Me
Very :) A good Catholic Friday fish and chips. Not supposed to eat meat on Fridays, so fish is the replacement. The pope must've been watching Madagascar too. 
Although probably just coincidence today :) x

09/01/2015 21:52:11

Me
Also - Billy Elliot! Looks awesome c

09/01/2015 21:56:05

Hayley
Loool! Oh no, fish and chips are awful cold!! Sorry :(. Yeh! The tickets are all on sale now, so we should book soon if we're going to!

09/01/2015 22:08:47

Me
I was hungry, didn't really mind :) Definitely! Let's book it tomorrow �� I'm rapidly shutting down, probably a good idea to go to bed. Can't wait to see you tomorrow! Love you �� Night x

09/01/2015 22:09:55

Hayley
Awesome :). Sleep well joeybert. Love youuu tooo ❤❤❤. Night xxxx

10/01/2015 11:28:38

Hayley
Morning Joebert!! Just got up. still got some waking up to then will give you an ETA. You sleep ok?xx

10/01/2015 11:40:16

Me
Morning Haze! Sounds good, can't wait :) Very well, thanks, feeling much more human. How about you? How're you feeling? X

10/01/2015 11:46:12

Hayley
Yeh me too, had 12 hours worth, definitely helps :). Feeling better each day, still not 100% but getting there! I'm just resting at the moment, have to recover from all that sleeping, then breakfast, shower, dress and leave. probs be a couple hours or so. Should I bring work stuff? Or is this morning and tomorrow enough working time?x

10/01/2015 11:56:22

Me
Yeah, no problem. That'll work out well, I'll make good use of the time. No need to bring anything aside from your good self! See you soon ��x

10/01/2015 13:24:25

Hayley
At mill hill, trains a bit messed up, but hopefully will be there around 3 ish. I'll let you know what train I get from liv street xx

10/01/2015 13:37:07

Me
That's great :D See you soon xx

10/01/2015 13:39:00

Hayley
Trains screwed, getting the tube. might be a bit longer :(

10/01/2015 13:46:07

Me
That sucks! Hope the journey goes alright. Do let me know when you get to Liverpool Street! Do you fancy going straight from the station into town? Xx

10/01/2015 13:46:27

Me
(The station is actually in town ��)

10/01/2015 13:48:59

Hayley
Will do. I'll probably wanna just go home if that's ok? Travelling is quite tiring.x

10/01/2015 13:49:44

Me
No worries :) I'll come pick you up from the station by car. Thanks for making the journey! Xx

10/01/2015 14:25:06

Hayley
At Liverpool street. Getting the 14.30 train.x

10/01/2015 14:28:55

Hayley
Be there at 15:02 :):)

10/01/2015 14:29:13

Me
Awshum :) So you should arrive just before five past. I'll be there :) see you soon x

10/01/2015 14:29:30

Me
Ah yep! ����❤️ x

10/01/2015 14:29:59

Hayley
I'm bored already. This is long. You'd better make me tea later :p. ��������

10/01/2015 14:31:34

Me
Haha! Of course ��

10/01/2015 14:39:17

Hayley
It stopped at Stratford even though it didn't say it would on the departure board... Is that normal? Or did I get the wrong train?

10/01/2015 14:39:42

Me
That's right, no worries!!

10/01/2015 14:40:04

Hayley
Lol ok. Coolio.x

10/01/2015 21:40:28

Hayley
I miss youuuuu

10/01/2015 21:40:36

Hayley
Alreadyy

10/01/2015 21:41:02

Hayley
❤Love you so much❤

10/01/2015 21:42:37

Me
I miss you too! Thanks again for making the journey :) Love you ��xox

10/01/2015 21:43:01

Me
Let me know when you make your connection! :)

10/01/2015 21:43:59

Hayley
It's not even a thing. had to come and see you. I'll keep you constantly updated don't you worry. I don't actually have anything else to do anyway so'll be texting ya :)

10/01/2015 22:10:54

Me
Well thanks anyway :) It's especially appreciated as you're ill :( You did seem a lot brighter than before! Hopefully it'll pass soon. And I'm still super excited for you! Although If we keep the lottery improvement up, maybe neither of us will actually need jobs? �� xx

10/01/2015 22:12:58

Hayley
Hehehe! Potentially. Thanks joebert, I guess I'm excited too :). Wish we coulda had more time together today, still on for next weekend? :)xx

10/01/2015 22:13:15

Hayley
Hows the rest of your evening looking?x

10/01/2015 22:21:15

Me
Yeah, I know :) Definitely! Of course I want to see you! We were good today though, stuck to the no staying over rule. As much as it sucks :( Going to spend as much of it as possible working, then picking up Jonny and walking Ash. Have you got anything at all to keep you occupied? Xx

10/01/2015 22:28:32

Hayley
Yer it sucks, but was defs the right decision. Thanks for being sensible with me :). You're such a hard worker, thats awesome :). Yer been browsing 9gag. Keeps me occupied enough. On the tube now :)

10/01/2015 22:50:00

Me
No worries :) Just feeling quite motivated is all! Wanna get this to a good level. Got the potential to do quite well, so got to act on it. That's good! Glad you've got summat. Not long until home now, anyways, right? X

10/01/2015 22:52:35

Hayley
Ybbbb. Awesome sauce :). Yer, 10 more mins or so until mill hill.x

10/01/2015 22:53:22

Me
Can't wait til you're saying the same thing to me :)

10/01/2015 22:54:17

Hayley
Lol me too!

10/01/2015 23:11:05

Hayley
Homeeee :)

10/01/2015 23:16:26

Me
Good good! Not toooo bad then. Thanks again for coming! How're you feeling? Going straight to sleep? X

10/01/2015 23:19:12

Hayley
Not too bad at all, all went smoothly :). Feeling ok, quite tired, will probs sleep in a bit but not straight away. You?x

10/01/2015 23:26:33

Me
Very glad :) Sounds good, I'll probably follow suit. Just got in from picking up Jonny, going to get back to it now for a bit x

10/01/2015 23:31:30

Hayley
Trying to subdue the urge to call you to say good night... Don't wanna disturb you...

11/01/2015 10:53:54

Hayley
Just wanted to say good morning :).x

11/01/2015 14:27:09

Hayley
Back from walk. Was nice but now a bit tired lol... Hows work going?x

11/01/2015 14:46:09

Me
Oh good :) Probably still not 100%, but walks have magic powers, so it's worthwhile. Been alright, got a little progress. Going to keep crackin'. Getting into it yourself? X

11/01/2015 14:59:45

Hayley
Yer, just making a tea then gonna crack on :). Miss your face x

11/01/2015 15:22:21

Me
Miss yours too xx

11/01/2015 16:21:33

Hayley
Joebert! Joebert! Joebert!




Hi ��

11/01/2015 16:26:23

Me
Haha :) Hey Hayley, how's it hanging? X

11/01/2015 16:27:33

Me
Got much done? ;)

11/01/2015 16:28:37

Hayley
All good, went to the toilet and was bored so texted you :). I just ate a fish finger sandwich and now I'm eating a jammy dodged. Thought you'd want to know :).

Yer some, difficult to figure out what to include and what to leave and what order to put things etc, but we're getting there :).

11/01/2015 16:28:44

Hayley
You?

11/01/2015 16:53:06

Me
Haha! I'm glad you did :) Been stealthily working my way through my secret chocolate stashes. Biscuit tin's next.
You'll get it perfect :) It's an opportunity to show off how good you are. Of course it'll be easy ��❤️x

11/01/2015 17:39:08

Hayley
Lol nice one!! The alcoholic ones too? Or giving them a miss for now? ;)
I've come over super tired and lethargic :(. Gonna get these slides finished off then rest I think. might go through it again a bit later but we'll see. 
Hows it all going at your end?x

11/01/2015 19:04:24

Me
Nah, gonna save those for when you're feeling less terrible :)
Sorry about that :( Good idea! Take it easy, there's no rush. You'll get it all done.
All going very productively for me, got some solid project work done, and gone through to organise my paperwork. My parents and grandad came back, so chatted to them and had dinner for a while. Apparently it's been a very good trip. Hope you're feeling a bit less crap! X

11/01/2015 19:12:50

Hayley
Yer I guess, felt brain dead at some point so had to stop. not used to actually using my brain lol! Still got more to do but might leave it for now and crack on in the morning, bit stressed but should be fine. 
Oh thats cool! Productive day then :). Glad they had a good time. My fams are still on their way home (went to Bournemouth) so I'm just sitting around alone, should probably have some dinner too...x

11/01/2015 19:47:44

Me
Don't be stressed! It's all good. Working on it tomorrow after a good rest and letting your brain cool down a bit should be really helpful. So the most productive thing you can do right now is chill :)
Nooo, you're all alone? Sorry Haze :( Hope they had a good time. Apparently my aunt has made a huge recovery! She's physically doing really great, but because she's been stuck in one room for 30 years, she's mentally deteriorated a bit. Still, my Dad got to talk to her for the longest time in years.
Feeling any better? X

11/01/2015 19:50:13

Me
Oh, and do you have any cue cards? Just found loads xx

11/01/2015 20:05:46

Hayley
Did a bit of chilling, brain still a bit melty, family came home and they're all making noise and cba for them. 
Omg that's really awesome!!! I'm so glad for her! And must've been awesome for your dad to be able to chat properly :), great news! 
Lol I have some, but i dont think I'll need them, gonna take print outs with me inthibk! Thanks though :).xx

11/01/2015 21:06:45

Me
Ah right. Still got a little ways to go, then? :( Maybe yakult is the solution... ��
It's really amazing. Although apparently she is a bit... different. I think she's a little confused, but nothing that won't get better with time. Still though, it's awesome for the whole of my Dad's side of the family!
Ah right. You'll probably have it all in your hea anyways. Did you manage to get any more done? :)
Sorting my paperwork turned into going through all the storage in my room. Getting there now. You can feel your brain sorting itself out as you do it :)
We forgot to buy Billy Elliot tickets! X

11/01/2015 21:30:29

Hayley
Lol yakult. Might even be a good idea but would have to go out and buy some so allow! That's understandable, but really awesome news!! 
Nah didn't get any more done, brain too friend, but hopefully still enough time tomorrow :). Loool, find anything interesting? Good to get things sorted and in order, really need to do my cupboards...! Oh yehhh shhiiit. If we decide a date I can book them tomorrow! Bare in mind I'm poor now so will have to be the super cheap tickets!x

11/01/2015 22:06:48

Me
Of course! No worries, still plenty of time :)
Found loads, actually. Including about half my wardrobe, folded up from around Christmas and just before. Basically new clothes! Now I know why I couldn't give you any good tshirts :)
But yep, sorted out my financial stuff and notes since starting at UBS. Very helpful stuff. All organised and categorised in folders now. Do it! It's a surprisingly good feeling.
I'm properly excited to see this now! No worries, I'm in the same boat there :) Are there any dates that you can't do, or would rather avoid? Xx

11/01/2015 22:10:10

Me
We could go on Wednesday??

11/01/2015 22:11:59

Hayley
Oh no, to soon, I need to sort my life out this week and next probably. We should book it for a couple of weeks time I think - if thats ok with you?x

11/01/2015 22:15:28

Me
Yeah, just saw tickets were available pretty much immediately. Been looking, there are no £20 tickets on a Friday or Saturday. Maybe a Thursday sometime next month? X

11/01/2015 22:17:03

Hayley
Hmm, how much more are the fri/Sat tickets? Might be best to go one of those days :)

11/01/2015 22:25:46

Me
Generally, they're £43.30, so any one you fancy really, although it seems there is an exception for the matinee 14.30 performance on Saturday 28th Feb where you can get the tickets that are normally £76.70 for £47.50. Looks like the only deal like that. Whaddaya think? X

11/01/2015 22:27:15

Me
Oh, that's on a few more Saturday matinees too x

12/01/2015 10:05:12

Hayley
Morning joebert :)

12/01/2015 10:14:09

Hayley
Had a dream that I gave you a wedgie... You weren't happy with me...

12/01/2015 11:52:33

Me
Morning! Hmm maybe it was atomic? You have the most amazing dreams. Well real Joe forgives you! Hope you're having a good day so far! Xx

12/01/2015 12:01:36

Hayley
You were going on about how your balls had exploded... I was like "sorry joebert...". Anyway. Yep all good so far :)

12/01/2015 12:48:36

Hayley
Turns out you were in sophages dream too :):). Although hers was slightly more normal. You were just going on about how amazing I am etc, lol :):)

12/01/2015 13:00:26

Me
Ew. How very uncouth of me. Although I suppose you did wedgie me so hard my testicles exploded... So may have been appropriate :)
That's no dream! ��

12/01/2015 13:03:09

Hayley
Actually I think you were just in a lot of pain and being melodramatic! Anyway, just a dream. Lol!!
Finished writing my presentation, need to time and practice it now, woo. Can't wait to get it over and done with and actually get on with my life!!! Also can't wait to see you soon ������.xx

12/01/2015 18:03:10

Me
Miss you

14/01/2015 17:29:05

Hayley
Whatsapps not sending. I'm at liv street :). No rush of you gotta work late or anything :)

16/01/2015 17:43:45

Hayley
Waiting near boots.x

20/01/2015 08:07:20

Me
Morning :) have a fantabulous day xx

20/01/2015 08:19:14

Hayley
Morning!!! So nice out this morning :). Hope you have an awesome day too!

20/01/2015 13:06:29

Hayley
I am SO hungry! Glad it's lunchtime yaaaay :). What you guys having today?x

20/01/2015 13:13:50

Me
Tesco picnic :) Pretty gross, tbh, but at least it's cheaps. What've you gone for? Xx

20/01/2015 13:15:35

Hayley
Whaaa? Why gross?? I usually like Tesco lunches :). Gone for soup in the canteen, was really yummy, contemplating buying a sweet to have later with my tea...

20/01/2015 13:17:39

Hayley
Soup was heavy and cream based though (hence the yummy...) So not sure... Might just do it anyway :):):) gonna get faaaaat. Ybyb joebert. miss ya face!!! Although if I'm being honest I slept sooo well last night, guess i still got some getting used to having a sexy boy in my bed to do ;).xx

20/01/2015 13:17:59

Hayley
20/01/2015 13:49:08

Hayley
I have no regrets. Yummmmmmmmmm .x

20/01/2015 16:30:56

Me
Lolz! :) I don't blame you, sounds really good! Tescos stuff always seems a bit... grey to me. Still though, fun times with Samwise.
Of course you had trouble sleeping! It's really distracting :) Glad you got to rest up properly. Although I am rather looking forward to interrupting your sleep sometime soon... ;)
How's today been? Day 2! Xx

20/01/2015 16:48:33

Hayley
Yeh it can do... You gotta be crafty with it. eg it's always better to go to sainsburys if possible cos they include the posh sandwhiches in the meal deal :). It's cool you have Sam there. I say alone today like a lame-o haha. Oh well , the Rocky road slice in bought was bloody amazing and made up for my loneliness. Yes pleaseee, I welcome the distraction !! Got my grades back btw, got a merit, apparently my second marker didn't 'get' my research haha. Oh well, all done now :). Today's been cool, quite slow, lots of tea making to get away from the screen for a bit, kitchens kinda far away though which means a nice bit of exercise each time :)

20/01/2015 18:03:04

Me
Wahey!!!! A merit, you must be really pleased :D Gotta do something to celebrate soon.
Ooh good tip. Going to see if there's a convenient sainsburys nearby for tomorrow...
Sorry you were all on your lonesome :( Was there no one there at all today? I suppose at least there's fewer distractions. And How's the work itself going?? Xx

20/01/2015 18:29:36

Hayley
Lol thanks, but not really, that's the worst grade I've ever gotten...shoulda worked harder but oh welllllll!! At least I'm done :). 
People were around but everyone goes at different times... Not really a bad thing though :). The work is a little bit repetitive to be honest, but should be done with the task tomorrow and hopefully there'll be something else to do :).x

20/01/2015 20:12:51

Me
It's still something to be proud of! :)
Ah good good, glad you can see progress being made. Any word about anything after this week?
How's the evening been going so far? Decide to go bowling in the end? Xx

20/01/2015 20:28:22

Hayley
I guess :). No word yet really, it's just a matter of submitting the form, think it's nearly there but my supervisor has to do the rest. Evenings good, bought some new trousers and yeh've but cba tbh, just gonna play two games! How are youuu?

20/01/2015 20:52:29

Me
It is! That you've already set the bar so high is no reason not to celebrate this achievement too :)
Yeah, you probably could've gotten away with the torn trousers for a while, but probably a good idea not to risk it haha.
Glad you got across, even for a little while.
Been a bit off today, but made up for some lost time at work, and had a good long chat with my Sophage :) Those ridiculous headphones of mine got repaired, so just putting Angels and Airwaves and Biffy Clyro on the iPod for tomorrow. Thinking I might go for an early night tonight... Hopr the finger's ok! Xx

20/01/2015 21:00:20

Hayley
Yeh, and I could hear them tearing more across the day lol, so thought it best :). 
Whaaaat? Noooo!! Whyyy?? What was wrong????? :(:(:(:(:( ������������. 
Wooo, I NEED to update my iPod too tbh, job for the weekend. I wanted an early night tooo, still at bowling grrr. Hopefully wont be home too late! Finger is... Ok... for now :S

20/01/2015 21:25:43

Me
Yeah, not really something you want to go wrong! :)
Aww thanks for the concern, but it's really fine, just wasn't feeling so hot. Nothing a good night's sleep won't fix :)
A fully updated iPod is up there with fresh bread and clean sheets. Ahh. If you have any recommendations, I'm always looking :)
Glad the finger's holding up, enjoy the rest �� xx

20/01/2015 21:33:53

Hayley
But you're literally so hot... That makes no sense!!! ;);). Yeh good night's sleep is probably the ticket. If you're still up about 10 I might call you while walking home if that's ok?? No worries if not :)xx

20/01/2015 21:45:59

Me
Lolz. Thanks Haze, back atcha �� Sounds good! Speak soon xx

20/01/2015 22:21:22

Hayley
I'm gonna be free tomorrow. You wanna do something? Or should we just wait until Friday when we can chill properly ?

20/01/2015 22:21:40

Hayley
Soryy if you're asleep, just heard back from the girls.x

20/01/2015 22:29:56

Me
I'd love to. Might see how things are tomorrow, but otherwise sounds good :) Xx

20/01/2015 22:31:36

Hayley
Sure thing chicken wing. Sleep well.xxxxx

20/01/2015 22:34:47

Me
Thanks Haze :) Hope you do too. Sweet dreams xxx

21/01/2015 07:51:16

Me
Morning! Feeling much better after a good night's sleep. Must've been really tired yesterday. It's been snowing!!!! Did you see any yet? Xx

21/01/2015 07:51:36

Me
Don't think it'll be settling any time soon though :(

21/01/2015 07:55:04

Me
That said, starting to see snowy fields out the window ����

21/01/2015 08:34:01

Hayley
Aww glad :). I didn't sleep that well myself :(, throat was sore so kept having to wake up and have water. So annoying, will try again tonight! Snoooowwww yaaay!! None here, not even that frosty this morning compared to yesterday...

21/01/2015 08:54:32

Me
Nooo, sorry to hear that :( Is it feeling alright now? Got an extra pack of lozenges you can have in my bag.
Guess it must've just been in Essex. Still though, needs to happen when we're together so we can have that wintry walk...
Hope today isn't quite so lonely as yesterday. Maybe see you later on after work? Xx

21/01/2015 09:02:44

Hayley
Yeh its feeling better thanks! Just worried me cos that's what started me off last time I was illl!! Not gonna let it happen again though!! Oooh yeh wintry walk sounds so awesome :). I'm sure it'll be much the same, but not a problem. Don't know about later on, we could meet for dinner maybe? But I really need to try and get an early night! My eyes have such black circles it's looks like I've been punched in the face lol!x

21/01/2015 09:58:48

Me
Glad it didn't hang around! That would really suck, I guess you weren't kidding when you said you get sick often then! Fingers crossed nothing happens.
Maybe we should just wait til Friday to meet up? Either way, could do with another early night too! Although I don't think I look like I've been punched in the face... Hope you don't feel that bad too! Exciting new project to work on today, much more artistic than technical though. Enjoying getting my teeth stuck in. Hope today goes well, let me know how you feel about later on �� xx

21/01/2015 11:58:36

Hayley
Lol no I wasn't !! But just gonna overdose on berocca and vitamins and hope for the best! I dunno... I wanna see you but i also wanna sleeeep! Perhaps can see how we feel later? Sounds coooool, hope it all goes well :):)

21/01/2015 13:10:00

Me
*Sends hope*
Yeah, I know what you mean :) Good plan. How's it goin with you? Think you'll finish up that task today? X

21/01/2015 13:12:02

Hayley
All going fine. Finished a while ago, hope there'll be something else to do after lunch! What's your opinion on creme eggs?

21/01/2015 13:14:18

Me
Oh good :) So does that mean you're just sitting around for now?
They are, of course, the best thing to happen to mankind, and I've been searching since I was a boy for the mythical creme egg hen that Cadburys have been keeping hidden. Why'd you ask? X

21/01/2015 13:18:00

Hayley
Dunno... Heading back up now from lunch and I guess well see :). Oh right, good response!! Bought a couple, will save you one :)

21/01/2015 13:18:48

Me
Aww fanx xx

21/01/2015 13:23:15

Hayley
Bought them cos I heard they changed the recipe... Wanted to see for myself!

21/01/2015 16:42:18

Me
I don't know how you're feeling, but I reaaaally am up for seeing your beautiful face, even if only for a little bit :)

21/01/2015 16:43:55

Me
Totally cool if you're not quite feeling up to it today, though xx

21/01/2015 16:57:00

Hayley
Hahaaa sounds good. But only for dinner yeh? Promise we'll be sensible? 
Where / when should we meet? Not sure what time ima finish...

21/01/2015 17:30:33

Hayley
Just packing up to leave. No idea where to meet you - perhaps st Pancras? Or should I come to liv street? Both will take 20-30 mins!

21/01/2015 17:31:55

Me
So long as you promise too :) St Pancras might be a good idea... Could also try somewhere new. Either way, say 6? Xx

21/01/2015 17:33:38

Hayley
Yet 6 is good. You out of the office yet? I'll call you when I get down and we can figure it out.

21/01/2015 17:34:28

Me
I'll be 5 mins, sounds good :))

21/01/2015 17:37:02

Hayley
Cool beans. You call me cos I'm already out :)

21/01/2015 17:38:39

Hayley
Coooooold

21/01/2015 17:48:20

Hayley
Be there about 10past. Meet me at st Pancras? In our spot that we say goodbye? :)

21/01/2015 17:50:55

Me
Sounds good :) see you soon sexy x

21/01/2015 22:00:26

Hayley
So basically

21/01/2015 22:03:04

Hayley
I sprinted all the way down, and when I got there on the board it said my train had gone! But I still had a good 30 seconds to get it, so i sprinted down to the platform and as I got off the escalator I heard the door closing bleeps so I made a run and jump whilst literally shouting "noooo" and I made it onto the train!!! Woop woop!! Hearts still beating pretty fast. thanks to you for the extra adrenaline boost!! Woulda been another half an hour wait otherwise!!

21/01/2015 22:03:47

Hayley
Musta looked like a Crazy person... Hahaaa

21/01/2015 22:04:06

Hayley
Also, love you ❤❤❤. You so beautiful.xxx

21/01/2015 22:09:54

Me
Wow! Holy crap, that's really amazing! I imagine the other passengers were pretty impressed too :) Really glad you made it!!
I really enjoyed tonight :) Sorry about being a bit off earlier, but thanks for being there and your usual awesome self!!!

21/01/2015 22:11:22

Me
Can't tell you how much I love you. Feel so much better for having seen you. And oh my god your piano playing!

21/01/2015 22:11:58

Hayley
It truly was :):). Yeh man me tooo. Please stop apologising, we're both gonna have off times sometimes, it's all part of the package :).

21/01/2015 22:12:36

Erm, hang on, that sounds weird

21/01/2015 22:16:46

Hayley
I'm home and stuff :). Cba to wash my hair... It can just be dirty tomorrow. You home?x

21/01/2015 22:50:00

Me
Glad you're back safe :) No worries, maybe spend the time sleeping instead haha. Not home yet, but next stop Chelmsford so it's all good. And at the risk of repeating myself, thanks so much for being you, Hayley. Love you from the bottom of my heart x

21/01/2015 22:51:38

Hayley
❤ I love you too ❤

21/01/2015 23:17:24

Me
Got back a little while ago, but got talking to my Dad. Goodnight Hayley! Really enjoyed seeing you. Sleep well xx

21/01/2015 23:18:07

Hayley
Nighty night my love!!! Sleep well!xxxxxxxx

22/01/2015 07:54:24

Hayley
Morning sexybert :)

22/01/2015 08:07:44

Me
Morning sexyhaze! Oh my god that was so fun last night with the piano :D we've got to do that again sometime!
Realised this morning that I'm actually excited to get into work. It's happened!
Hope you have a great day today, can't wait to see you again soooon �� xxxx

22/01/2015 08:33:35

Hayley
Hehe yeh it was really fun!!! I'm glad we got to do that :). Woooooo yeahhhh for you :):). Hope you do too!!! I'm seeing you tomorrow right?? ��xx

22/01/2015 08:54:10

Me
Ybybybyb! :) Did you get to catch up on your sleep? Xx

22/01/2015 08:57:08

Hayley
Loool! Don't know about catch up, but definitely slept really well last night. Gotta learn how to get to bed a bit earlier though and then sorted :)

22/01/2015 08:59:27

Me
Gooooood! :) Yeah, that may have been my bad. Got really excited about the piano... :D 
We'll figure it out xxx

22/01/2015 09:12:38

Hayley
Narrr, got home early enough but didn't get my head down for a little bit - need that extra bit of chill time but probs should have just gone straight to sleep...! Oh well. Feeling pretty well rested this morning so all in all pretty good :)

22/01/2015 10:30:09

Hayley
My new trousers are slightly too short and my ankles are cold...

22/01/2015 12:46:14

Hayley
Apparently I look 'Shoreditch'. Not sure if a good thing...!

22/01/2015 13:47:17

Me
I know what you mean, that decompression time can't really be skipped. Glad it didn't keep you from feeling good today though :) thought that was kinda the fashion with women's trousers? Still, sucks to be impractical. Ankle scarves maybe? Seems a bit more practical. Take the Shoreditch comment as a compliment! Figure out why afterwards :D Who said that? Xx

22/01/2015 14:02:11

Me
Ooh and got a free lunch today. Don't know what it is about food being free that makes it so much taster...

22/01/2015 14:45:55

Hayley
Yeh apparently it's the trendy thing to do, but I just feel like a bit of a knob... Ankle scarves! Brilliant idea :). It was tolulu who said it.
Omggg free food is the best kind of foood!!

22/01/2015 18:24:54

Me
Own it! I'll bet you look amazing. Although my judgement is a little biased, I'll think you look amazing in anything. And I did just posit the use of scarves for your ankles. ...aaanyway
That's a bit weird, did he explain what he meant by it? I guess it's an up-and-coming, fashionable (probably ankle scarf wearing) type of place? ��
Found myself enjoying today quite a bit, tbh. Definitely getting the hang of using Flex again. Oh, and booking another gig with Sam for March :D
How's today been for you? Did they have any work for ya? Xx

22/01/2015 18:36:50

Hayley
Lol!! Yeh its where all the hipsters live, I think he was trying to be nice cos ones bitching about my short trousers... Woo thats awesome! Yeh today was good, enough to get on with :). Don't have to go in tomorrow either but might work a bit from home if I feel that way inclined :)x

22/01/2015 18:50:09

Me
Ahh, gotcha :) A day off! Ridiculous. What'd you be doing from home? And I don't suppose you've got any more news about the application? X

22/01/2015 18:56:24

Hayley
Not a day off cos I'm not formally working. Only half a days work to do so ima do it from home instead of traipsing in. Nope, nothin yet.x

22/01/2015 19:39:42

Me
I know, just teasin' :)
Good plan batman xx

22/01/2015 19:46:38

Hayley
Eaten my bodyweight in pasta and chocolate

22/01/2015 19:46:59

Hayley
Feel sick. But also soooo happy :)

22/01/2015 19:47:30

Hayley

22/01/2015 20:40:41

22/01/2015 21:23:34

Sleep well! (or ...continue to do so) ���� xx

23/01/2015 08:01:46

Me
Morning! Have an awesome day ��

23/01/2015 08:49:36

23/01/2015 09:51:43

Hayley

25/01/2015 22:55:36

Hayley
Home safe :):). Welcome joebert!!! Glad i could have been there!xx

25/01/2015 23:00:10

Hayley

25/01/2015 23:00:51

Me

25/01/2015 23:01:10

Me
Nah, quite tired actually! Would've been a bit pointless

25/01/2015 23:01:54

Me
I hope the journey was alright! Got Ace Venturas down x

25/01/2015 23:02:56

Hayley
Yeh was completely fine, apart from those pesky speed restrictions grrr. Wooooo! :)

25/01/2015 23:03:07

Me
Really had a lot of fun with you this weekend :)

25/01/2015 23:05:52

Me
Hope everything goes well with Opa :) Sure I'll speak to you before you see him, but just in case. Have a good nights' sleep, Haze! Night ��

25/01/2015 23:07:25

Hayley
All quite routine, will be good to see him :). Gotta make the bed err, no one else did it! Thanks joebert, you too!! Night night!

26/01/2015 07:33:49

Hayley
But, let's start the day !! Tea...

26/01/2015 07:43:57

Hayley
Oh, and hope you haven't forgotten to eat proper breakfast!! :)

26/01/2015 07:56:35

Me
Morning :) Tea counts as a proper breakfast, right? Either way, getting something in London for this morning

26/01/2015 07:57:39

Me
Good luck with your challenge too x

26/01/2015 08:27:16

Hayley
Thanks! Saw the rest of those cakes from yesterday... First test passed. S'gonna be an annoying one! Question: am I allowed teacakes? The ones with the raisins that you toast?x

26/01/2015 08:27:44

Hayley
Omg, trains all fucked, gonna be so late!

26/01/2015 08:41:28

Hayley
Tube = gay = I'm going to be laaate. What you gonna get for breakfast?? :):)

26/01/2015 11:48:50

Me
Yeah, they're okay; one of the few cake exceptions. Hope you got in for a reasonable time! Ended up getting pret porridge

26/01/2015 11:49:57

Me
Living life on the edge

26/01/2015 11:54:08

Hayley
Yeh, was completely fine, they have quite flexible arrival times here, still annoying though. Woooo yuss, gonna have them for teaaa :). Oooh good choice! Gonna get expensive though....!

26/01/2015 13:29:03

Hayley
Omgomgomgomgomggggg. Can't believe what I just did!! Was having a chat with someone in the team and they brought in cookies, offered me one, and i absent mindedly took one and started eating!! After a few bites I realised I wasn't supposed tooo!!! And now I don't know what to do... If I don't eat it now it's quite offensive... I can't believe I already broke if!! I was so good all morning and so excited to be good this week! What should I doooo? Hide it? Throw it away? What if he notices???

26/01/2015 13:30:10

Me
Eat it! It's about the spirit of the thing, not absolutism

26/01/2015 13:30:48

Me
And no feeling bad! You're not allowed

26/01/2015 13:31:39

Me
I'll think up some kind of small penalty :)

26/01/2015 13:31:49

Me
Perhaps...



Celery.

26/01/2015 13:33:40

Me
I also have a confession...

26/01/2015 13:40:06

Me
I ate my porridge... At 11.25.

26/01/2015 13:44:28

Me
But yeah, can't believe you, Hayley, grr !

26/01/2015 13:54:52

Hayley
That's so much worse than accidentally taking a bite a cookie!!! Tut tut joebert. We both have much to improve on for tomorrow!! nah I'm not gonna eat it, either do it properly or not at all!

26/01/2015 13:55:08

Hayley
Also, there is no way I'm eating celery, Fuck that shit!

26/01/2015 13:55:39

Me
Shoulda thought about that before the cookie then

26/01/2015 13:56:20

Me
Maybe talk to big bird and the count about it?

26/01/2015 13:56:30

Hayley
It was a complete accident!!!!!!

26/01/2015 13:56:36

Me
Because you're clearly a Cookie Monster

26/01/2015 13:57:03

Hayley
Hilarious! -_-

26/01/2015 13:57:41

Hayley
I feel so annoyed. I really wanted to do it properly!

26/01/2015 17:43:43

Hayley
Fooking hell its cold

26/01/2015 17:51:14

Me
Life is not about perfect scores. It's about learning and being better

26/01/2015 17:52:21

Me
Anyways, yup! It's freezin'. How'd the rest of the challenge go today?

26/01/2015 17:53:54

Hayley
Ok joeberttttt. Still, 11.25...!?!?! How'd you even manage that?
Went awesomely, even resisted the go ahead bar as punishment for my earlier indiscretion!

26/01/2015 17:59:10

Me
I was busy! Plus, my challenge was 3 meals a day, with breakfast being the one I skip most often. Lunch was a whole margarita pizza, so I'm still on track. Glad it went well! Definitely don't need the celery punishment. Until next time... (evil cackle)

26/01/2015 17:59:21

Me
Get any more help with the application?

26/01/2015 18:11:24

Me
Decided I'm going to the gym tonight. And, my Dad just sent me this:

Baked potatoes cheese sauce bobbi beans sweet corn and curly kale plus a sausage and pork chop for dinner (plus melon for dessert) hope your hungry )(

Guess I might be overdoing this whole 'challenge' thing...

26/01/2015 18:14:53

Hayley
The one you skip most often, hence the one you need to put most effort into :) !. Yeahhh gym! Good lad :). And yumm! Nice reward for getting to the gym!

26/01/2015 19:08:41

Me
Yeah, alright. I've been looking forward to this for a little while. Have a good evening x

26/01/2015 20:05:19

Hayley
:):). Hope it all goes well and you don't get too knackered! Do some exercise for me :P. Making good progress on the application, getting quite excited. worried that its quite long and too personal statement-y... Thinking of showing it to the dudes at work to get some feedback... 
Got a reply from the admin dude about the grant application, he didn't seem too happy with what we'd proposed... So... who knows what's gonna happen. but I'm.not getting my hopes up. Gonna focus on this new application!

26/01/2015 21:19:59

Me
I was convinced by Jonny to start with a "home gym" day with him. Definitely could've pushed a bit harder, but ah well. It's a start.
Gym tomorrow! Probably would've been sick after that dinner, anyways :( / :D
Used the extra time to sort out meals, budget and get my reading list ready.
Send it to me, I'll take an honest look.
Sounds like nothing you didn't already suspect a bit already. Bit sucky, but plenty of doors still very much open to you. To the next one!

26/01/2015 21:20:10

Me
Hope you've had a good evening with Opa ��

26/01/2015 21:28:00

Hayley
So much of that needs explaining. Send you the reply? Ok will do. Just finishing off for the the night. might call you quick once in bed?x

26/01/2015 21:33:26

Me
The reply and the application so far. Sounds good :)

26/01/2015 21:38:25

27/01/2015 08:03:24

Hayley
What you having?x

27/01/2015 08:04:30

Me
I'm good, me, ain't I? Breakfast baguette waiting in the office fridge. Got lamb chop lunch ready this morning too. So domestic!

27/01/2015 08:05:30

Hayley
Nice :):). Off to a great start :)

27/01/2015 08:06:03

Unreal city, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, I had not thought death had undone so many.

27/01/2015 08:34:48

Hayley
A work of Mr J Hoare? Or...?

27/01/2015 08:37:02

Me
Nah, TS Eliot x

27/01/2015 08:37:33

Hayley
Ah right. Lovely :)

27/01/2015 08:38:43

Me
X

27/01/2015 08:40:55

Hayley
Although I'm not sure I understand it... Death had undone so many? So they're dead or alive??

27/01/2015 08:52:00

Me
It implies tat death is a state that humans enter and exit. They're alive, but just about :)
Just looked it up, it's a line from Dante's inferno, when the narrator is shown all the people in hell. Hmm. Definitely not the tone I got from Eliot... Guess that's poetry for ya. 
Anyways, have a good day x

27/01/2015 15:00:05

I want a biscuit.

27/01/2015 22:06:47

Me
Hey, are you in? X

27/01/2015 22:12:50

Hayley
No :(. Had to get the tube and then there's no bus so I'm waiting :(

28/01/2015 07:30:53

Hayley
Baaaaad dreams :(:(. Bad bad bad :(:(:(:(:(:(:(

28/01/2015 07:34:41

Me
Morning! Noooo! What happened?

Also, sorry about being a bit of a douchenozzle last night... X

28/01/2015 07:51:00

Hayley
Basically I did something stupid without realising and then you were gonna break up with me and it was awful, I woke up so depressed and didn't sleep well the rest of the night :(. 
Also, you weren't, you were just being the nozzle to my doucheyness. No more apologies, except from me ! Sorry :(. Love you joebert ❤. Really hope under you face soon xx

28/01/2015 07:51:30

Hayley
*I see

28/01/2015 08:00:47

Me
That sucks! I'm really sorry to hear about that �� Hope you're not going to be too tired today...
And no apologies necessary. I just ree-hee-hee-aly want to see you! Love you too ❤️ xx

28/01/2015 08:57:00

Hayley

28/01/2015 13:11:00

Hayley
http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html?_r=0&referrer=

An interesting article :). We should go through the questions sometime!! (Dont look at them now though !!! I haven't :) )

28/01/2015 15:22:19

Me
Sounds fun! Quite looking forward to going through those :) Must make a trip to Cafe Rouge sometime soon... Keeping up with our challenge well today, egg and salmon breakfast! Not quite as good as the one we made though... How's it been today? Still avoiding rogue cookies?Xx

28/01/2015 15:31:59

Hayley
:):). Hehe nothing will match that, it was so yummy. good your keeping up with your challenge. all good my end challenge wise. although in general today's been a bit of a struggle, so tired and feel a bit iffy, can barely concentrate on work... Took a leaf out of your book and had some green tea, so yucky! But better than coffee I guess!x

28/01/2015 18:28:15

Me
Sorry about the late reply! I ended up staying a bit later at work, barely noticed the time. Sorry you're feeling a bit off! Do you think it's the lack of sleep? Hope you feel better ❤️❤️

28/01/2015 18:29:13

Me
*think it's all the lack of sleep

28/01/2015 18:30:36

Hayley
No worries. I'm still at work myself. Gonna leave soon though. Although trains still screwed so a tube nightmare awaits :(. Yeh I'm sure it's that. hopefully will get an early night tonight!x

28/01/2015 18:30:45

Hayley
How was your day?x

28/01/2015 18:38:15

Me
Probably a good idea, a good nights sleep works wonders! Hope the journey isn't too 'yesterday's poem'-esque ��
Mine was good, still working on my own little section. Having a surprising amount of fun with it, actually! Looking forward to the big meal when I get back, too. How was yours? I hope the tiredness didn't affect you too much? Xx

28/01/2015 18:52:48

Hayley
Lol. I'm sure it'll be fine!Sounds good! Not great, was I'm like a weird daze for most of the afternoon and couldn't concentrate . The green tea seemed to help though!

28/01/2015 19:46:25

Me
Ah that suuuuucks. Hope you get there soon!
Turns out my Grandad had a checkup this morning, and was after sent to A&E for some tests, where he and my mum have been since. Hopefully it's just precautionary x

28/01/2015 19:49:08

Hayley
Noooo!!!! What's happened??? Is he ok???

28/01/2015 20:14:04

Me
Should be ok, just heard they think it's gastric ulcers. Obviously, that still sucks and everything, but phew! He's just got back with my mum now, should be having that dinner soon :) Hope you're evening's going ok x

28/01/2015 20:15:55

Hayley
Ok. I'll stop panicking now. Sorry to hear about the ulcers :(. Yeh going fine, just got back a little bit ago made some dinner :). First time I've had dinner at home in ages!

28/01/2015 20:43:27

Hayley
Not being allowed pudding literally sucks!

28/01/2015 21:06:44

Me
Yeah, I was a bit too. Very good news though :) haha, You're clearly just far too popular! Still though, good to save a bit of money. You can totally have pudding! It just has to be fruit, or... ok, maybe there are no puddings that qualify. Yeah, that sucks. X

28/01/2015 21:31:48

Me
Got time for a call before bed? X

28/01/2015 21:34:35

Hayley
Lol not popular, I haven't even seen anyone recently, don't know what I've been doing... Working I guess! I had a toasted teacake yaaaah :) it was soo yummy!!
Of course my love, for you I always have time. What time were you thinking of calling?x

28/01/2015 21:43:23

Hayley
Just watching the undateables. Call you after? :)

28/01/2015 21:46:25

Me
Sounds good to me :) Speak to you soon ��

29/01/2015 09:19:02

Me
Morning! Really looking forward to seeing you :) Have a good day ��

29/01/2015 11:08:42

Hayley
Yeahhhhh! Got in so late cos of the bloody trains so will have to work until at least 6. Maybe a little later :( Hope thats ok! Can't wait to see you though!!!!

29/01/2015 13:00:53

Me
No problem at all, could use the extra time myself. Aren't we the hard workers? :) x

29/01/2015 13:05:13

Hayley
Lol!! Will let you know later on when ish I'll be done. still cool to come meet me? Perhaps i should meet you since i have the travel card... Hmm... What kinda time do you think you'll be done?x

29/01/2015 14:51:05

Me
Sounds good to me :) Nah, I'll come meet you, it'll be good to check out a somewhat new place. I can stay for however long, really, but around 6 if I was choosing. Could easily stay a bit later though, if you feel you need?
We should do that questionnaire tonight :) x

29/01/2015 15:20:17

Hayley
Omggg just had a meeting with Howard and be gave me loads of feedback on my application. Have a lot of work to do on it now. might try and get some done before the end of the day but have actual work to do to.. ahhh. Might have to stay a little later to work on it. but yeh, will let you know!
Really hope I get to see you!!xx

29/01/2015 15:30:45

Hayley
Omg and now I'm meeting with Taku at 6.15 to finalise the other form. So we won't be able to meet until 7 ish, if at all...! That ok?x

29/01/2015 16:50:57

Me
Hey no worries :)

29/01/2015 18:18:48

Me
I'll be staying at the office for a while anyway, but if you need to be getting on with this now, that's no problem. Probably best to keep going, now you've worked this hard on it. Besides, we'll see each other at the weekend xx

29/01/2015 18:19:13

Me
Hope the meeting with Taku is going well x

29/01/2015 18:20:40

Hayley
He doesn't seem to have arrived yet. how long you gonna stay at the office?

29/01/2015 18:21:36

Me
Not sure really, could leave now, could leave in an hour. What're you thinking? X

29/01/2015 18:22:23

Me
Although I'm leaning towards sooner

29/01/2015 18:27:11

Hayley
Dint worry joebert just go home. I feel bad to keep you! Only going to meet Taku now and still have a lot of work to do on the application :(

29/01/2015 18:29:15

Me
Nah though?

29/01/2015 18:30:36

Me
I'd much rather wait a bit longer and see you for half an hour, than wait til Sunday x

29/01/2015 18:33:36

Me
But if not, as I said, no worries. Know you've got a lot on x

29/01/2015 18:51:14

Hayley
How about 7.30? You can just take a longer route to get here :)

29/01/2015 18:53:50

Me
Sounds like a plan. See you soon x

29/01/2015 19:17:19

Me
May be about 5 mins late, sorry x

29/01/2015 19:26:54

Hayley
Lolol no worries.x

29/01/2015 19:35:05

Me
I'm here, where are ya?

29/01/2015 19:35:48

Hayley
Just packing up and coming down!! See the huge building in front of you with the yellow bits. I'll be coming out of there!x

29/01/2015 19:39:57

Hayley
I'm the liifffttt

29/01/2015 21:51:00

Hayley

29/01/2015 21:54:24

Hayley
I know, I Love it so much!!!

29/01/2015 21:54:46

Hayley
Trains delayed ahhhh

29/01/2015 21:56:25

Me
Really looking forward to the weekend! Noooo! Ah, shoulda come with me :)

29/01/2015 21:57:11

Hayley
Yeahhh trainnnn!!! But yeh, still shoulda come with you...!

Something in that burger didn't agree with me... :(

29/01/2015 21:57:19

Me
Hope they get moving soon!

29/01/2015 22:01:13

Me
WooHoo! Gotta get an early night, so you can be all productive tomorrow :) Sorry about that! Maybe it was eating while having the awkward talk? :) x

29/01/2015 22:03:36

Hayley
Yeahhhh. Gona try and get in early too! 
Nar that wouldn't have made a difference. Think it was something in the party... eh well. worth it.x

29/01/2015 22:20:01

Me
Definitely a good idea! That's sucky. Hope it's just a passing thing! And thanks for staying out for a while tonight, I'm really glad we got to see each other :) Hope you still get a good rest in xx

29/01/2015 22:22:28

Me
Oh, btw, got the first season ready for each show we talked about :) Except Girls, I really really tried, but all that showed up was porn :(

29/01/2015 22:27:18

Hayley
Yeh should be fine :). No probs g, we didn't stay out late at all! But yeh I'm so glad we had a bit of time to recalibrate :). 
Awesomee!! And looool! Thats hilarious. We can still watch it online though :). 
Bad news about the weekend, "not appropriate" apparently, which is fair enough I guess! I'm happy to come see you though if you'll have me :) I can drive up and we can drive back on Sunday ?

29/01/2015 23:00:31

Me
Definitely! :D Looking forward to getting stuck in. That's fair enough about the weekend, but yeah yeah yeah come here! Of course you're welcome. Excited :) Home safe now. Night Hayley! ❤️��

29/01/2015 23:02:12

Hayley
Yayayaaay cool. Glad you're home safe. Loveeee. xxx

30/01/2015 07:38:18

Hayley
I definitely didn't sleep with your scarf last night...

30/01/2015 07:38:31

Hayley
(I did ��)

30/01/2015 07:38:47

Hayley
And it was awesome!!!!!!!!

30/01/2015 07:39:02

Hayley
Not as good as the real thing though...

30/01/2015 07:39:13

Hayley
❤

30/01/2015 08:08:26

Me
Haha :D Glad you made the most of having it back! Got my face all covered up with yours now. Not long to wait for the real thing. (Saturday, right? Also more than welcome Friday, if you've got everything done��)
Has it snowed in Mill Hill? Chelmsford's white! Xx

30/01/2015 08:10:11

Me
And I'm sat across from a Goth on the train. A real, actual goth! I didn't think they still existed...

30/01/2015 08:31:52

Hayley
Woohoo!! Yeh either tonight of tomorrow, we'll see later :). Nop no snow here... Awesomeee, has it proper settled and everything?? Can we build a snowman??
Lol! Neither did I! Crazy times!x

30/01/2015 08:44:48

Hayley
Got in pretty early today :). You'd be proud of me :)

30/01/2015 09:46:20

Me
Awwwwwwshum :) Yeah, it has! Hopefully it tops up a bit too (after you've driven over, ofc ��)
I know, really weird. But a commuting goth, at that. Probably on his way to work as a mortgage advisor or something. 
Go you! Hope you kick today's butt �� x

30/01/2015 17:53:52

Me
Hey! Not sure if you got my text this morning... :(
How's the butt-kickin' gone today? Xx

30/01/2015 17:56:30

Hayley
Which ones?? Last one I got at 9.46...

30/01/2015 17:57:42

Me
Didn't miss any :)

30/01/2015 17:59:30

Hayley
Woo! Legit just forgot to reply my bad! Day was alright, heading home now! Spent most of it on the application lol so lots to do on Monday now but oh well! Hows your day?!xx

30/01/2015 18:14:44

Me
No worries, today's gone by quick for me too :) Well that's good! Feeling good about it? Today's been fun, still at the office just finishing up a couple bits. Think you might be heading over tonight? X

30/01/2015 18:26:34

Hayley
Erm... Ish. Don't know how bothered I even am at this point... But we'll see! Not sure really, would like to! But I guess will have to see how i feel later on. Does it matter how late I'll get there?x

30/01/2015 18:35:21

Hayley
Omggg the phone conversation we had on Wednesday cost me 12quid!! I forgot my minutes were up!! Don't let me call you from now on!

30/01/2015 18:56:34

Me
Well fingers crossed :) It'd be great to see you whenever, but probably a good idea to check how icy it is when you see about it later on. 
That suuuuucks! £12 is way too excessive! Yeah, no kidding! Xx

30/01/2015 19:10:16

Me
I've got a frankly ridiculous number of minutes, so I'll just call by default. Looking forward to seeing you! (Today or tomorrow) Hope the dinner goes well ��

30/01/2015 20:17:31

Hayley
Just rounding up dinner. Think it's cool to come tonight or best to wait till tomorrow?x

30/01/2015 20:17:51

Hayley
Also, I ate pudding without realising :(:( so annoying!!!

30/01/2015 20:18:23

Me
TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT TONIGHT

30/01/2015 20:19:00

Me
Ahem. Yes, it would be cool.

30/01/2015 20:19:17

Me
Don't beat yourself up about it. What was it? X

30/01/2015 20:20:38

Hayley
I need to shower and things so won't be leaving for an hour ish though... Hows it looking ice wise? Safe to drive you reckon?

Apple crumble made my ops, was so yummy!  Stopped eating when i realised though... Hope he wasn't offended...!

30/01/2015 20:36:11

Me
No worries! I think so, but depends on what you think too. Apple crumble's so close to acceptable! If it was chocolate or ice cream or something, that'd be a proper violation. But good on ya for stopping x

30/01/2015 20:37:26

Hayley
There was ice cream with it... =(

I'm gonna come :).

30/01/2015 20:47:36

Me
But ya stopped! Even if you hadn't, it was accidental.
YAY! Can't wait ❤️❤️

30/01/2015 20:47:51

Me
Let me know when you're setting off! X

30/01/2015 21:01:37

Hayley
Oh mah way.x

31/01/2015 19:13:15

Hayley
All ok?

31/01/2015 19:13:44

Me
Yep, guess it's just not ready yet. Or they think I don't

01/02/2015 19:52:05

Hayley
Just making sure yasemins ok!

01/02/2015 20:21:01

Me
There are actually no trains to Chelmsford at all

01/02/2015 20:29:48

Me
Gonna get buses. Fun times ahead :)

01/02/2015 20:32:08

Me
Not too bad. Only another 25 minutes, could be worse

01/02/2015 20:34:53

Me
Have fun! And everything went fan-dabby-dozily today, I'm sure Sophage and Mehmet really appreciate it :) Love you x

01/02/2015 20:41:28

Hayley
Wtf!! Busses? Want me to come get you and drive you?

01/02/2015 20:45:06

Hayley
That's literally so gay!

01/02/2015 20:45:46

Me
Haha, thanks for the offer, but it's seriously not even that bad. Still getting home at a reasonable time. Cheers though, G :)

01/02/2015 20:46:19

Me
Have fun with the guests of honour :)

01/02/2015 20:47:56

Hayley
Lol! Ok. Hope it really isn't that awful. I know I'd hate that! Thanks g, will do. text me when you're home. X

01/02/2015 21:16:45

Hayley
You alive?x

01/02/2015 21:17:48

Me
Yeah, sorry, was going to text when I got home :) All good, just on the last bit, bus to Chelmsford. Did folks come over? X

01/02/2015 21:36:54

Hayley
Oh right. Soorry just wanted to make sure !! Oh good. Hope its not too much longer!! Yeh, just a couple of people, soph mem yas and sherms :)

01/02/2015 22:00:59

Me
Home safe :) Wasn't too bad at all xx

01/02/2015 22:02:02

Hayley

02/02/2015 08:04:24

Me
Also - jigsaw tonight :D

02/02/2015 08:33:33

Hayley
Looololoolll. Haha, we'll see about that.
Yeahhh. Puzzle or nickleby? That is the question !!

02/02/2015 08:50:36

Me
Yeah, we will ��
Im glad the trains were running again today! Having to take the bus in would NOT have been fun. Hey, the challenge was for one week, right? Think I'm going to keep going with mine, at least for a bit longer x

02/02/2015 08:51:00

Me
What's your plan? And Nickleby! Nickleby! Xx

02/02/2015 08:51:18

Me
And maybe also some jigsaw ��

02/02/2015 08:54:10

Hayley
Omg that would have suuucked! I'm definitely carrying on! I really like it!! 
Lol! I guess it depends how much time we have. I really really really don't want to go to bed late!!xx

02/02/2015 08:58:37

Me
Sweet! Good on you. But maybe don't feel bad for eating Opa's crumble :) I agree, this morning was tough! Good luck with all that work today ��X

Me
Hey! It turns out that I've actually gotten a lot more done than I'd thought, and tbh I quite fancy leaving a bit earlier today. Up for meeting up at, say, 5.45? X

02/02/2015 11:11:59

02/02/2015 17:40:48

Hayley
Hmm. What's the top bit?

02/02/2015 17:41:28

Me
The walkway between the platforms :)

02/02/2015 17:42:54

Hayley
Here!

02/02/2015 17:44:02

Hayley
Call me :)

03/02/2015 09:23:01

Hayley
Ahhhhh just introduced myself to the boss dude of the position I applied for!! Stressssss. He said "I'm sure you'll hear from us soon" with a smile on his face though so I guess that's a good sign!! I wasn't prepared though and he asked me a whole bunch of questions ahhh. Just made a some crap, hope I didn't come across retarded!

03/02/2015 09:34:39

You won't have come across retarded! He knows that people aren't going to be all bright eyed and bushy tailed first thing on the commute in. It's a really good thing, now there's a face to the application paperwork. I'm sure that, despite having to make up crap, he'll still have gotten a good impression of you :)

That's exciting :)

Sorry about the late reply! Been stuck around people in one way or another all day.
My god, that sounds amazing. Gotta go sometime... although I imagine you'll be good for a while :) I miss your face too! Can't wait to see it again. And to watch Nicklenuss Nicoowlbee with you.
Really sorry you're not feeling too great! Hope it passes soon xxx

05/02/2015 18:27:17

Greg had me really worried just now - he came over all bearer-of-bad-news-y, said my section had a bug that meant it needed a big architectural re-design. Would've taken days. Turned out, someone had just commented out one line of code. Phew!

05/02/2015 18:36:15

Me
Hope you're feeling okay ��

05/02/2015 19:26:10

Hayley
No probs gggg. Yeyeyehhh. I'm ok, just tired and period-y. Omg stressful! So glad it was sorted quickly!!
Joebeeee, I really wanna eat some caaaake. Feel like scrapping this diet it's so depressing :(

05/02/2015 20:26:38

Me
Noooo! Not yet, anyways. Maybe give it 24 hours, if you don't think scrapping it's a bad idea in that time, go for it ? But hold strong for now! You can do it! Xx

05/02/2015 20:29:40

Me
How's your evening going? Just had a big dinner with the fams. My Grandad was talking about the snow causing problems in Spain, and my Dad said "But I thought it mainly rained?"

Sucks. What happened? Morning ��

06/02/2015 08:34:55

Hayley
It was so weird, some of my friends decided they were pissed at me and slapped me around the same time, and then it was my birthday and they'd organised a surprise breakfast but it was awkward cos most people were pissed at me, and you were there cos you'd taken the day off work to spend my bday with me, but when I came over to you you were holding hands with yasemin and I was like wtf...

06/02/2015 08:53:48

Me
That is really weird... Hope you're okay. Just to reassure you, there ain't nowt going on between me and yasemin :)
We need to watch Lion King now...

Me
Ah, could Sophage not do Thursday? That could be good too! Puts a bit of space between Thurs an Friday's stuff x

09/02/2015 09:27:21

Hayley

09/02/2015 12:42:51

Hayley
It's only an interview!!! Gotta pass that first before all that crap is true!

09/02/2015 12:43:08

Hayley
But thanks for your enthusiasm :)x

09/02/2015 12:47:30

Hayley
The only slot they had available was Monday...!!!! What should I do??? Thats too soon, I have too many plans this week :(:(

09/02/2015 12:51:02

Me
Do it!!!

09/02/2015 12:51:16

Me
I'll help you get ready at the weekend :)

09/02/2015 12:51:41

Me
You'll definitely not get it if you don't attend. Better to try and have the chance

09/02/2015 12:53:34

Hayley
There's no way I'm not going for the interview, I just mean I might have to reschedule some stuff so that I have enough time to prepare! I get really stressed about these things and need to have enough time to prepare properly.

09/02/2015 13:12:17

Me
You've got this. We can just stay out for the minimum time each night this week, and maybe you could speak to someone at work about reducing the time you're in the office, or potentially take a couple days off? Plus, we can always celebrate valentines next week. We'll make time �� x

09/02/2015 13:13:22

Me
I know you're the type of person who needs to prep thoroughly, but no matter how much time you spend, you're going to do really well. Don't stress about it, you're still going to have a great bday week x

09/02/2015 13:39:01

Hayley
Yeh, I think I'll take thurs/Fri off. And perhaps tomorrow (supervisor dude is off anyway). Might have to shift vday :(:( but I don't know.. Will have to see how it goes. Thanks joebee!!! I'm good, not stressed but just wanna get preparing. Sure I'll be shitting myself later on though!

09/02/2015 14:22:07

Hayley
Ok, rescheduled to wednesday morning! Sun/mon/tues should be enough time! :)

09/02/2015 18:39:06

Me
That's FAN-DABBY-DOZEY! Got loads of time now. Did you manage to get Thurs and Fri?
Hope you had a good day today. I imagine this was on your mind a bit! Stayed a bit late at the office to make sure I can leave on time tomorrow :) Getting ready to have infinitea over soon? Xx

09/02/2015 18:47:31

Hayley
Nah, don't think I need thurs and Fri off, not sure whether I'll go in tomorrow or not though and might take Fri off just for fun. we'll see. Stayed late myself so still on the way home, will meet them at home in a bit! Yehhhh. So hungry. you had a good day?x

09/02/2015 19:05:43

Me
No harm in having a little too much time :) Sounds good either way. Did you have a lot on today, or just fancied balancing out the time off? Today was goooood :) Samwise was on form at lunch, definitely helps to balance out an otherwise stressy day. And spent some time fixing something with the new guy. Felt a bit like repeating stuff I've just learned myself really. Going to try for the gym tonight :D
Is the whole gang there? X

09/02/2015 21:21:31

Hayley
You make it to the gym then fatty??? :):)
Yeh man, were all here, had our dinner, having our tea and goodies now.x

09/02/2015 21:30:43

Me
Genuinely did try! But my mum and Grandad picked me straight up from the station, took me for dinner with them and asked me to sit and have a long talk with Jonny. (He's looking at taking an apprenticeship, and somehow everyone thinks I'm the guy to talk to).
I'll make up for it (but not really much) with push ups and sit-ups. THURSDAY! ��
When I put my card details in for the lottery, I realised I remembered it all. Didn't even take it out of my wallet. Just in time for my new contactless today :)
Sounds good! Have fun! Gimme a text when you're finished, wanna say goodnight �� x

09/02/2015 23:10:52

Hayley
I'm so sorry I know it's getting late but were still chatting...!

09/02/2015 23:13:39

No worries! Just enjoy, I'll still be up :) Have fun ❤️x
