12/08/2014 15:32:45: Hayley: Hey hey, turned on my data for a bit, so thought I'd say hi :)
12/08/2014 15:33:04: Hayley: Hope everything's good with you :).x
12/08/2014 15:46:11: Joe: All good, better now :) How's Norway? I should warn you about Wednesday, I'm pretty competitive x
12/08/2014 15:47:19: Hayley: Better now? What was wrong?
12/08/2014 15:47:37: Hayley: Norway is... Pretty ok. Haven't seen too much of it yet, been at sea!
12/08/2014 15:48:01: Hayley: Noted! I am too if I'm being honest...!
12/08/2014 15:54:27: Joe: Just work stuff, all good but lots going on. I'm glad the nation is doing alright, take good care of it! You're with your family, right?
Sounds like it'll be a grudge match. You're going dooown
12/08/2014 15:56:33: Hayley: Haha ok, will do.
12/08/2014 15:56:56: Hayley: I'm not with them right now, but yeh we''ve gone away together :)
12/08/2014 15:57:01: Hayley: Haha yeh, sure I am !
14/08/2014 13:27:27: Joe: I was just thinking... but there's Nor-way you're gonna beat me on Wednesday. 
Nor-way. Geddit? X
15/08/2014 12:54:19: Hayley: Truly hilarious
15/08/2014 12:55:34: Hayley: 10/10 for effort at least :)
15/08/2014 12:56:38: Hayley: What would happen in the unlikely event that I do beat you? How will you handle being beaten by a girl...?
15/08/2014 23:24:00: Joe: ...and I thought my joke was bad. Fighting talk :P
I hadn't really considered that possibility. Yeah, if you win... nah, I'd have to see it first :) x
15/08/2014 23:34:19: Joe: We'll have to wait and see.
18/08/2014 07:59:04: Hayley: Hehe, yep, we will see !
18/08/2014 18:06:01: Joe: Welcome back :)
How was Norway?
18/08/2014 18:13:06: Hayley: Helloo :)
18/08/2014 18:13:27: Hayley: It was lovely thanks :)
18/08/2014 18:13:45: Hayley: Kinda feels like I was never away, now that I'm back...
18/08/2014 18:13:55: Hayley: How're you?
18/08/2014 18:43:35: Joe: Holiday timewarp. Glad to hear :)
Things are going really well, just hoping my brother gets what he deserves on Thursday (otherwise his job at McDonald's might become permanent)
Ready to lose spectacularly on Weds? :) Meet outside for 10 to 6 X
18/08/2014 20:17:56: Hayley: Good luck to your bro !
18/08/2014 20:18:20: Hayley: Lol, yes, I'm ready to lose -_-
18/08/2014 20:18:24: Hayley: If lose means win!!!

22/08/2014 20:19:22: Hayley: Look what I made :)
22/08/2014 20:22:26: Joe: Naww you shouldn't have. Hidden talents :)
22/08/2014 20:29:40: Hayley: Who said it was for you..?
22/08/2014 20:31:23: Joe: Lol good point :)
22/08/2014 20:32:19: Joe: Oh and erm, maybe because you sent it to me? :P
22/08/2014 20:32:58: Hayley: Yeh I was just showing you...
22/08/2014 20:33:25: Hayley: But yeh, it's for you :)
22/08/2014 20:33:33: Hayley: If you were here I'd give it to you :)
22/08/2014 21:13:39: Joe: :) knew it x
22/08/2014 23:20:04: Hayley: :) hope you've had a nice evening.x
22/08/2014 23:25:39: Joe: It's been good, had a celebratory meal for my brother. How's you? X
22/08/2014 23:30:27: Hayley: Sounds lovely :)
22/08/2014 23:30:41: Hayley: Me's good thanks :)
22/08/2014 23:31:17: Hayley: Met a creepy man at the train station so had to run away and get the tube :(
22/08/2014 23:40:00: Joe: Good idea. That's a bit weird, are you ok? X
22/08/2014 23:40:23: Hayley: Yeh all good
22/08/2014 23:40:54: Hayley: He was gonna be on my train tho so I just thought it'd be best to avoid
22/08/2014 23:41:53: Joe: Definitely for the best, better to be safe
22/08/2014 23:42:16: Joe: Weirdos everywhar
22/08/2014 23:42:27: Hayley: Yerp
22/08/2014 23:42:47: Hayley: Especially on Friday nights, and for some reason they all see to talk to me... Booo
22/08/2014 23:43:24: Hayley: I'm really happy that I learnt how to make the paper flower tho :)
22/08/2014 23:45:02: Joe: That's the problem with being pretty. I'd say I have the same problem, but not really
22/08/2014 23:45:35: Joe: Never really thought about what it's like for anyone else late on
22/08/2014 23:45:54: Joe: Kinda sucks really
22/08/2014 23:46:16: Joe: The flower was good :) someone teach you?
22/08/2014 23:47:42: Hayley: Yeh, there was a guy showing his mate how to do it outside and we were watching him and he came and gave the one he made to us, and then I asked if he'd teach us and he did
22/08/2014 23:48:07: Hayley: I've wanted to learn how to make them for a while, so it was really cool :)
22/08/2014 23:52:19: Joe: Ah right, that makes sense. Seemed a bit odd without context :) Used to do some origami when I was younger. Ever tried it? Well maybe now...
22/08/2014 23:52:48: Hayley: Yeh I've dabbled
22/08/2014 23:53:09: Hayley: Made a frog once, took me about an hour... Was meant to be studying
22/08/2014 23:53:32: Hayley: And I'm fairly adept at napkin folding...
22/08/2014 23:59:59: Joe: Haha :) seems like the time when you're supposed to be studying is when you find out just how creative you can get. The pressure of a deadline makes you suddenly realise all these new interests :) napkin folding is an art I haven't tried yet. Towels in hotel rooms are always an impressive one
23/08/2014 00:04:59: Joe: Btw, I have a habit of saying "you" when what I really mean is "me" or "people in general". Don't know why
23/08/2014 00:05:43: Hayley: If you give me a towel I can make a chicken and a penis.
23/08/2014 00:06:02: Hayley: And yeh, the boredom of studying is great and bringing out creativity :)
23/08/2014 00:06:24: Hayley: S'all good, you mean the collective "you", I do the same :)
23/08/2014 00:20:19: Joe: Remind me to give you a towel one day.
I once sent an origami shirt to (pre war-crimes) Tony Blair, my Grandad's still got the signed photo somewhere.
Glad you're alright with my linguistic eccentricities. They're a bit esoteric :)
23/08/2014 00:20:55: Joe: Are you around on Monday? X
23/08/2014 00:22:32: Hayley: Haha will do! That's pretty awesome! You're basically famous now. 
Lol esoteric eh?
23/08/2014 00:23:08: Hayley: I have a feeling that there's something going down on Monday, but I can't quite place it, so yeh I'm around :)
23/08/2014 00:31:57: Joe: Good enough for me :) Haven't figured out what yet, but let's do something. Brain's giving out on me for now
23/08/2014 00:32:21: Hayley: Cool
23/08/2014 00:33:11: Joe: Going to give in to it. Night Hayley x
23/08/2014 00:33:34: Hayley: Same here actually. Nighty night.x
23/08/2014 00:33:46: Joe: :)
26/08/2014 18:34:55: Joe: <video omitted>
26/08/2014 18:48:26: Hayley: Hahaa!! Brilliant!
26/08/2014 18:53:38: Joe: Very glad to be able to help my mum out in her time of need. Got away with it this time...
26/08/2014 18:54:03: Joe: Anyone in your family been caught yet?
26/08/2014 18:55:59: Hayley: Heh my bro did his yesterday
26/08/2014 18:56:09: Hayley: Was actually a really funny video
26/08/2014 18:56:23: Hayley: He didn't nominate me though thank gosh
26/08/2014 19:07:59: Joe: Seems much more enjoyable when it's family for some reason. Had a show on in the background where one character hadn't seen Star Wars. It's officially a weird thing
26/08/2014 20:11:13: Hayley: Well yeh, cos you got to chuck ice over your mum! Way more fun than watching celebs or whatever
26/08/2014 20:11:28: Hayley: And yes I know it's weird.
26/08/2014 20:11:31: Hayley: Deal with it
26/08/2014 20:11:34: Hayley: :)
26/08/2014 20:50:07: Joe: Yep, that's probably it. Maybe I like that you're a little weird... But at some point, we've got to watch Star Wars or Indiana Jones, it's up to you which :)
26/08/2014 20:52:17: Hayley: Both
26/08/2014 20:52:22: Hayley: MARATHON!
26/08/2014 20:54:00: Hayley: Although to be honest, it's probably best to chose a movie you don't mind missing... Cos chances are very little movie will actually get watched.
26/08/2014 20:54:05: Hayley: Just sayin...
26/08/2014 20:54:06: Joe: Oh dear god you are literally perfect
26/08/2014 20:54:14: Joe: Whoa whoa whoa
26/08/2014 20:54:58: Hayley: Just telling it like it is
26/08/2014 20:55:59: Hayley: Or are you telling me that you're going to happily sit next to me on a couch for 6+ hours while we watch movies without trying it on??
26/08/2014 20:56:06: Hayley: If so, I'm offended.
26/08/2014 20:58:18: Joe: Actually lol'ed. You're right. Seriously, how...
26/08/2014 21:02:07: Joe: Marathon it is :) may have to repeat a couple of times though, because at some point, these movies must be seen haha
26/08/2014 21:02:40: Joe: Get some sleep on Thursday so we can hang out on Friday, yeah?
26/08/2014 21:02:50: Joe: :)
26/08/2014 21:03:17: Hayley: Seriously, how... What?!
26/08/2014 21:03:26: Hayley: Sure thing, sounds good to meee
26/08/2014 21:03:41: Joe: Couldn't finish my sentence without it sounding corny as he'll
26/08/2014 21:04:44: Joe: by which I mean hell, thanks autocorrect
26/08/2014 21:05:39: Joe: Why is time linear? Why isn't it always Friday?
26/08/2014 21:06:04: Hayley: Lol, was just thinking something along the same line..!
26/08/2014 21:06:28: Hayley: Line? Eh ? Geddit? Linear! Line...! Haha I'm hilarious
26/08/2014 21:06:51: Hayley: But yeh if Friday could hurry up and be tomorrow, that would be great :)
26/08/2014 21:08:32: Joe: :) You really are amazing. See, corny as he'll.
26/08/2014 21:09:26: Hayley: I know, it's a curse
26/08/2014 21:09:51: Hayley: And I love corny so carry on at your leisure :)
26/08/2014 21:31:40: Joe: Seriously, don't get me started. Or do, but on Friday. I just feel very lucky :)
26/08/2014 21:31:47: Joe: Cheese overload
26/08/2014 21:32:30: Hayley: Aww :)
26/08/2014 21:32:54: Hayley: Yeh pretty cheesy, but also very sweet :)
26/08/2014 21:33:48: Hayley: I have a bit of a confession though: I was thinking today, what if this is just one of your phases and that soon you'll be bored of me?
26/08/2014 21:39:17: Joe: Sometimes when things have happened to me before, or I've experienced hard or good periods in my life, there's always been a deep sense of transcience, that time will sweep away whatever I try to build or whatever mistakes happen. Believe me when I say that this doesn't feel like that. There's nothing fragile or temporary about the way you make me feel.
26/08/2014 21:39:46: Joe: How's that for cheese
26/08/2014 21:40:19: Hayley: 😊
26/08/2014 21:40:35: Hayley: You're awesome :)
26/08/2014 21:44:37: Joe: Yeah, I know

26/08/2014 21:52:49: Hayley: Woo

26/08/2014 21:53:19: Joe: Yes, totally
26/08/2014 21:53:45: Joe: Where can we go where we actually sit next to each other? ;)
26/08/2014 21:55:03: Hayley: Ermmmmmm
26/08/2014 21:55:10: Hayley: Anywhere
26/08/2014 21:55:27: Hayley: But if we want to be comfortable
26/08/2014 21:55:50: Hayley: Ermmm
26/08/2014 21:55:59: Hayley: ...thinking...
26/08/2014 21:56:09: Joe: :)
26/08/2014 21:57:07: Hayley: What area are you looking at? Help me narrow it down.
26/08/2014 21:58:22: Joe: I was thinking South Bank, near Waterloo
26/08/2014 21:58:57: Joe: Unless you've got a favourite  haunt elsewhere?
26/08/2014 21:59:44: Hayley: Southbank is always a good shout
26/08/2014 22:00:03: Hayley: Especially if the weather is nice
26/08/2014 22:00:25: Hayley: Nah i don't have a favourite haunt really...
26/08/2014 22:01:05: Hayley: Did you have anywhere in mind around south bank?
26/08/2014 22:01:37: Hayley: I always struggle a bit with that area bexuase it's quite touristy and commercialised, nowhere cosy
26/08/2014 22:02:06: Hayley: But it's bloody beautiful to walk along, especially at night :)
26/08/2014 22:05:54: Joe: Not really, been there before but you're right, doesn't seem like there'll be anywhere cosy around
26/08/2014 22:07:04: Joe: We have literally all of London to choose from :)
26/08/2014 22:07:53: Joe: Except maybe Stansted, or Dagenham. We have all of the central part of London to choose from
26/08/2014 22:33:00: Joe: Do make sure to watch the pineapple video I mentioned :)
26/08/2014 22:45:36: Joe: Night :) x
26/08/2014 22:55:34: Hayley: I will :), niiight. Sleep well x
27/08/2014 11:37:07: Hayley: That pineapple video was strange, and very long, didn't realise it would be so long... I'll try watching it again and start a little earlier next time :)
27/08/2014 12:40:59: Joe: Yeah, it's a bit of a weird one. For some people, it induces asmr, that feeling of the hairs standing up on the back of your neck. Doesn't work for everyone though :(
27/08/2014 12:50:16: Hayley: Autonomous sensory meridian response? I'm familiar with it, but have never tried to self induce it... Will give the video another crack :)
27/08/2014 12:50:25: Hayley: Does it work for you?
27/08/2014 13:12:20: Joe: That's the one, we talked about it on our first date. That one does work for me, but the majority of them don't. Just have to find your particular triggers x
27/08/2014 13:19:50: Joe: It sounds like you knew about it before? X
27/08/2014 13:20:34: Hayley: Oh right, cool.
27/08/2014 13:20:52: Hayley: Yeh, my friend was banging on about it a while ago..
27/08/2014 13:23:02: Joe: Yep, there are some devoted fans. I'd say they're crazier than McBusted fans.
27/08/2014 13:34:00: Hayley: Haha, is that even possible?
27/08/2014 18:08:23: Joe: Yeah, I hear they're a dodgy bunch, those McBusted folks. Any places come to mind for Friday? X
27/08/2014 18:10:07: Hayley: Yeh, they're a bunch of twats...
27/08/2014 18:10:15: Hayley: Ermmmm.... No
27/08/2014 18:10:22: Hayley: Not yet
27/08/2014 18:11:15: Hayley: Soz
27/08/2014 18:11:31: Hayley: I'll have a butchers when I get home :)
27/08/2014 19:46:36: Joe: I'll have a look in a bit x
27/08/2014 19:47:25: Joe: How's you get on today?
27/08/2014 19:53:13: Hayley: Good thanks
27/08/2014 19:53:18: Hayley: Well good enough :)
27/08/2014 19:54:12: Hayley: Yourself?
27/08/2014 20:00:58: Joe: Pretty good too. Realised I'd been a bit of an idiot though
27/08/2014 20:01:19: Hayley: How so?
27/08/2014 20:01:59: Joe: Took you to the British Museum. The 2012 cauldron is actually at the London Museum
27/08/2014 20:02:20: Joe: Must've mixed the two up somehow
27/08/2014 20:02:32: Joe: No wonder we couldn't find it
27/08/2014 20:02:53: Hayley: Ohhh riiight
27/08/2014 20:03:02: Hayley: Well they're not too difficult to mix up!
27/08/2014 20:03:28: Hayley: I haven't actually been to the museum of London though, so that would be cool for some other time :)
27/08/2014 20:05:45: Joe: Deffo. Might end up at the Natural History Museum, but that's cool too :)
27/08/2014 20:06:19: Hayley: Nahh, there's no mixing that one up!
27/08/2014 20:14:45: Joe: Just looking. Have you been to Paramount before?
27/08/2014 20:15:01: Hayley: What's that?
27/08/2014 20:16:25: Joe: A bar on top of Centre Point, just next to Tottenham Court Road station. One option
27/08/2014 20:16:40: Hayley: Awesomeee
27/08/2014 20:16:59: Hayley: Bare in mind it'll be Friday so all those kinds places will be heaving!
27/08/2014 20:17:48: Joe: Good point, seems like the sort of place that gets busy quick too
27/08/2014 20:18:28: Hayley: Wanna just meet up and wander round and see what we find?
27/08/2014 20:18:47: Hayley: Although that can sometimes be frustrating, might be fun :)
27/08/2014 20:18:59: Joe: But what about my years of Scout training? I made a pledge you know
27/08/2014 20:19:16: Hayley: Haha
27/08/2014 20:19:28: Hayley: Feel free to make a plan
27/08/2014 20:19:43: Hayley: I'm just really bad at it...
27/08/2014 20:20:40: Joe: Haha no worries, I'm happy to sort something out. I'll find a place that's open late, we'll start somewhere else and if we make it there, we make it there

28/08/2014 09:36:40: Hayley: Will defs give it a go at some point though :)
28/08/2014 11:55:19: Joe: Just a reminder - you're gorgeous x
28/08/2014 11:58:37: Hayley: Randommmm, but thanks :)
28/08/2014 12:41:24: Joe: Sounded a bit less creepy in my head :)
28/08/2014 12:42:18: Hayley: Wasn't creepy, was nice :)
28/08/2014 23:25:16: Hayley: Not sure I get the whole pineapple thing...
28/08/2014 23:29:33: Joe: It's a little weird, I know
29/08/2014 07:38:19: Joe: No worries. These things are very subjective, but worth a go! Please tell me you didn't watch the whole video...? :)

Meet me at Embankment for 6.30 x
29/08/2014 08:35:50: Hayley: Nooo, got a little of the way in and it wasn't really working for me, so gave up.
29/08/2014 08:35:59: Hayley: Alrighty, see you then :)
29/08/2014 17:55:17: Joe: Might be up to 10 mins late :(
29/08/2014 17:55:43: Hayley: No worries
30/08/2014 00:26:50: Hayley: Thanks again for the trip on the Eye :)
30/08/2014 00:31:14: Joe: My pleasure :) Let me know when you get home safe x
30/08/2014 00:54:29: Hayley: Home.x
30/08/2014 00:58:08: Joe: Night Hayley. Sorry if I was a bit flat tonight, feeling a bit exhausted tbh. Ah well. See you soon x
30/08/2014 00:59:25: Joe: Just so you don't think it's you :)
30/08/2014 01:07:10: Hayley: No worries. Night.x
30/08/2014 11:37:58: Joe: Sleep is underrated. Definitely needed that, I feel significantly less zombie-ish now. Dim sum was cool! Sounded like it wasn't the best one ever, but I'd go again :) Did you reclaim your room in the end?
30/08/2014 13:39:44: Hayley: Yep, sis made my bed without me even having to ask. I'm so in love with her now.
30/08/2014 14:27:24: Joe: D'aww, that's sweet. This sounds odd, but, the Americans are very... American. One just asked if our water comes from a well. Do you think maybe they think England is actually just like Game of Thrones?
30/08/2014 14:29:07: Joe: Fully expect to be asked what the Lannisters are really like
30/08/2014 15:40:42: Hayley: Haha! Yeh thats the best way to describe Americans... As 'American'. There's no other way !
30/08/2014 17:33:51: Joe: Quite like one guy in particular. A cousin of mine just had a son, and was saying they went to a baby barbecue. He said "how do they taste?" :/ :)
30/08/2014 17:34:40: Joe: Btw, have added you on the archaic medium of Facebook x
30/08/2014 18:26:00: Hayley: Lol, sounds like a joker
30/08/2014 18:26:05: Hayley: Sweet :)
31/08/2014 12:51:20: Joe: The Americans were very fun to hang out with, actually. I imagine they'll be saying that the English were so... English.
How did yesterday go? X
31/08/2014 15:25:42: Hayley: Haha! But that's the best think about english people!
31/08/2014 15:25:51: Hayley: Yesterday? What was yesterday?
31/08/2014 15:38:01: Hayley: Joe, I've been thinking a lot since Friday and I don't really know how to say this, but I'm not sure we should carry on seeing each other :(. I really enjoy spending time with you, and I thought I was ready to start something up again, but I just don't think I am and I don't want to string you along. I'm really sorry :(.
31/08/2014 15:38:34: Hayley: Also, I'm really really sorry for saying it over text, but I didn't know when I was next going to see you :(
31/08/2014 15:40:09: Joe: Seriously, don't worry, I totally get it
31/08/2014 15:40:43: Joe: I was actually independently having the same thought and spent some time this weekend talking to my friend Sam about it
31/08/2014 15:41:15: Hayley: Lol, well that works out kinda well then...
31/08/2014 15:42:12: Joe: It's actually kind of a relief. Part of what we were talking about was the feeling that I just wasn't really sure what was going on
31/08/2014 15:43:12: Joe: I'd like to say the whole "let's be friends" thing, but that never really works out. I did really enjoy meeting you though!
31/08/2014 15:45:43: Joe: Not going to lie, still sucks though
31/08/2014 15:46:06: Hayley: Same, it really has been nice :)
31/08/2014 15:46:58: Hayley: But I'd say keep in touch, and if/when you move to London, by then things will be different and maybe we can go for a drink or something ? No worries if you'd rather not.
31/08/2014 15:49:45: Joe: I'd like that :) Hope you're doing okay x
31/08/2014 15:51:22: Hayley: Awesome :).
31/08/2014 15:53:11: Hayley: Thanks, yeh it sucks :(, but I think, for now anyway, it's for the best.x
31/08/2014 15:54:02: Joe: Agreed. But thanks for being upfront about it :)
31/08/2014 15:55:02: Hayley: Well there's no point being a bitch and making the whole thing worse, you deserve more than that.
31/08/2014 15:59:10: Hayley: But yeh, good luck with everything and maybe see you again :).x
31/08/2014 16:00:19: Joe: And same to you, too. Maybe sometime a bit further down the road. Thanks again :) x
31/08/2014 17:20:18: Joe: I'll still be here :)

I'll send you some of the Christmas market 😊 Spent today walking in the Black Forest, eating Schnitzel and trying beers, and swimming in the thermal baths. Lots of couples there. Made me miss you a bit. Now crashing for a bit before tomorrow's agenda. How'd your day go? Did you get to Heathrow? X
07/12/2014 22:58:45: Joe: Oh, and did you put another 20p coin in my pocket? :)

07/12/2014 23:12:26: Hayley: Nah, didn't get to Heathrow, just went straight home. day wasn't so good actually. Felt a bit ill so pretty much just slept all day and watched tv the rest. hoping I wake up feeling fine tomorrow!
07/12/2014 23:12:53: Hayley: The 20p wasn't me... Unfortunately.x
08/12/2014 10:48:57: Joe: It'd be cool, wouldn't it :) Things are going really well here, sorry to hear you're not feeling so great :( Did the day yesterday do anything to help? And yes, thermal baths are going on the list! Perhaps as part of just showing up at an airport and deciding where to go there and then 😀 x
08/12/2014 11:36:15: Hayley: What you guys up to today then?? :):)
08/12/2014 11:37:23: Hayley: Yeh yesterday helped, I didn't go to the birthday dinner in the end, just stayed at home resting. Still not feeling 100% today (booo) but trying to finish off this bastard project! And get it in either tomorrow or Wednesday!

08/12/2014 19:56:18: Joe: Went into Freiburg, had some German espressos, walked around the old town, shopped at the Christmas markets, had bratwurst and mulled wine and ate more chocolate than is medically advisable.

13/12/2014 23:14:36: Hayley: No need to be sorry! I just wanted to keep talking to you. but one must be sensible. Lots to do tomorrow.

14/12/2014 17:23:34: Joe: Yes, even with! You always look awesome :) 
Did a bit of research, the statue man is called Cumil, and is apparently a pervy up-skirt-looker 😳
The opera has got to be incredible. Enjoy! :)
Today's been good, surprisingly busy. Turns out that a lot of family, my brother included, are coming for Tuesday. Aside from that, think life's pretty much back in order.
Ooooooooh, really? That's very interesting 😜 
Enjoy tonight! 😘 x

14/12/2014 18:35:32: Joe: I'd been trying to get some work done with Princess Bride on in the background. Not the smartest move...
14/12/2014 20:21:41: Hayley: Haha awesome, you did more research than me !
14/12/2014 20:22:41: Hayley: Opera was good, turned out not to be an actual opera though, but just in an opera house - was the wizard of oz in fluent Austrian, I followed it well enough though :)
14/12/2014 20:23:22: Hayley: Of course the fans are coming, it's an important time for you to be together.
14/12/2014 20:24:09: Hayley: Hehe yeh, although I'll probs invite you over on Friday too, but we'll get to that later :)
14/12/2014 20:24:19: Hayley: Oooh yummm dairy milk oreooo!

14/12/2014 20:25:10: Hayley: Lol about the princess bride! Great idea in principle! But in practice... Eh...
14/12/2014 20:28:32: Hayley: The markets here are so awesome!!! Like a million times better than the ones in London. just went to one near the Rathouse, which in itself was awesome:

14/12/2014 20:31:58: Joe: Wizard of Oz still sounds cool! Glad you enjoyed it :) We expected a lot of family, but it seems even the most distant relatives are all coming. Hope there's enough space!
Yay, this weekend is sounding like it's going to be a good one :) 
And yes, a great idea. I do not think that means what I had thought that means...
Those markets look awesome! Probably even better than the ones I went to in Germany!
Say hi to your mum for me :) x
14/12/2014 20:32:37: Hayley: 5d51f500f78ee55a2f84c235e20663f4.jpg <attached>
14/12/2014 20:33:43: Hayley: She said hi back, and, she literally said this : " tell him he should be here with you, but I don't mind being a substitute" lol!
14/12/2014 20:34:24: Hayley: But that's a really nice thing about all your distant family members coming!! Just shows how well loved she was!! It's really an awesome thing :)
14/12/2014 20:38:46: Joe: I've heard about the soup-roll thing, I was always tempted as a lazy student but never got round to it. Looks good!
Your mum sounds funny, looking forward to meeting her 😉 Wish I was! Plenty of time for adventures of our own though :)
And thanks! She was a very popular woman. 
Missing you! X
14/12/2014 20:40:00: Joe: Great to have some quality time like this with your mum, really must do the same with mine sometime x
14/12/2014 20:45:42: Hayley: Yeh it was yummm, and we got the last one of the batch. very lucky! 
Yehhhhh, our own adventuressss!!! I canny wait!
Yeh, it's really nice to spend time with mama actually :), although I'm spending most of the time either thinking or talking about you... you defs should take your mum out asap!!! Will be nice for both of you :).
14/12/2014 20:50:46: Hayley: Oh and forgot to tell you, I was thinking the other day about a way that we could still hold hands when it's really cold, and i thought that some sort of two way accessible glove would do the trick. and then today at the market I noticed and glove thing with two hand holes, turns out they're called 'love gloves' gonna get one if I can find one that isn't too expensive ;)
14/12/2014 21:21:58: Hayley: SOPHAGE IS ENGAGED AHHH!!!!!! :):):):):)
14/12/2014 22:40:42: Joe: I did try to organise something one-on-one with my mum, but things are a bit tricky this week, and it's too busy for a while. Ho hum, something will come up soon. In the meantime, had a good long chat just now with both parents. Always a lot to laugh and think about with one of those 😄
Can't wait either :D Canny's a good word, especially if we go to Edinburgh :)
Love gloves sound like they'd work great! They might not be the most fashionable article going, but if they do the job I couldn't care less :) 
Yay Sophage and Mehmet! Congrats to them, that's awesome!! 😃😃
14/12/2014 22:53:02: Hayley: Yer fair enough, I guess there's a stuff going on atm. You'll find a time soon I'm sure :). Ooh that sounds cool, thinking and laughing is always good :). I hope they're both doing ok!! 
Lol me neither! I have no problem with the concept, but the name puts me off a bit... sounds like something else entirely... 
Wooo Yaya I know, it's so excitinggggg!!!
14/12/2014 23:01:38: Joe: Yeah, at the moment there's just a lot of planning going on for the next two days, so I think it's a bit hard to plan anything past that. Soon, though.
Yeah, it was a fun talk :) Got to see where they are with things, then they wanted to hear everything about you haha. It was actually very similar to the chat I had with Harry, talking about the things that make for a good relationship. They kept saying how much they liked you, and apparently my Grandad thought we were a lot alike :) 
Yeah, love glove, eh? Really does need a better sales team.
Do you know anything about how it went down yet?? X
14/12/2014 23:06:30: Hayley: Yeh thats understandable. I really hope everything goes well. 
Ooh, sounds interesting! I'd be interested to hear what it is they said about what makes a good relationship - can't imagine their advice is anything but gospel!
Lol did he? That's cool :):), I wonder how he thought we were alike..! Interesting :P.
14/12/2014 23:07:01: Hayley: Erm, I know what he had planned but I dont know what actually happened in the end
14/12/2014 23:07:14: Hayley: Hopefully will find out soon though :)
14/12/2014 23:07:38: Hayley: But for now I gotta go to sleep, I'm fooking knackered!

15/12/2014 18:11:54: Hayley: Actually, that was probably quite insensitive considering tomorrow. sorry joebert. Hope all is going ok at home.xxx
15/12/2014 18:15:40: Joe: Lol that's really sweet you'd say that, but why would that be insensitive? Sorry I've not responded today, what I thought would be a quick lunch ended up still going now! Had to slink away when I could. Believe me, I'm not easily offended by much :) Really looking forward to some time with Sophage and Mehmet!
15/12/2014 18:16:15: Joe: I got a chance to check my phone earlier, saw the photo. I'm really glad you're my girlfriend :)
15/12/2014 18:16:46: Joe: How'd today go for you? X
15/12/2014 18:17:27: Hayley: I dunno... Just in case innit. Lol no worries, sound crazy though! Is it a work thing? Still going or you've managed to run away?
15/12/2014 18:17:35: Joe: Btw, looking like the poshest looter ever in that photo :)
15/12/2014 18:20:57: Joe: It was! Had a huge meal at Taayabs, my boss brought about fifty of those huge cobras. I avoided them, but no-one who drank got away with less than two each. Then tried to find a go-kart track for about an hour, while I spoke awkwardly with the big boss of our unit. Pool was going when I left at six, they were talkig about bowling after and heading to a club. Whaaaaa
15/12/2014 18:22:49: Joe: Hearing developers make small talk is hilarious. Silence for a few minutes, then one of the bosses decides they should make an effort. "How's the wife, Ramesh?" 
"She is well."
...
"Good".
Back to silence
15/12/2014 18:24:34: Joe: What'd ya get up to today? X
15/12/2014 18:25:44: Hayley: Lol thanks, that IS the look I was goingn for! But if I was really posh my hat and scarf would be from channel or something!
Omg that actual sounds like fun!! You mean you didn't wanna stay for bowling and clubbing?? Party pooper...! ;)
Hahaa, small talk in the worst! Can only imagine that the two cobras each helped!!
15/12/2014 18:25:58: Hayley: Todayy we did a whole bunch of stuff and that
15/12/2014 18:26:23: Hayley: And now we're having dinner and I'm super exhausted and just want to go to bed
15/12/2014 18:26:33: Hayley: We must have walked miles and miles
15/12/2014 18:27:11: Hayley: And my back is really hurting from my stupid bag. you'll be more than welcome to give me a massage when I get back :)
15/12/2014 18:29:48: Joe: Actually I couldn't stay, because I have to go to a pre-funeral dinner tonight. That's like... really insensitive and that
15/12/2014 18:30:09: Joe: These 'jokes' don't help anyone, do they?
15/12/2014 18:30:46: Hayley: But yeh, we went to like 5 different Xmas markets, took a tram round the city with headphones which played us nice music and told us about the stuff we were looking at, then got there tube, which is well crappier than ours, tonsils next level place to ride on a big Ferris wheel type thing, then tubed back into town and went to a supermarket to pick up some goodies for presents (same stuff as the markets but cheaper) and now SCHNITZEL FOR DINNER!!
15/12/2014 18:30:59: Joe: A whole bunch of stuff and that sounds... Good! Looking forward to hearing the full breakdown when you're back!
15/12/2014 18:31:08: Hayley: And lol, no, they don't really. but whatever makes you happy :)
15/12/2014 18:31:39: Hayley: Just typed it out for you!!

15/12/2014 20:43:01: Joe: You'd make a beautiful Muslim fundamentalist
15/12/2014 20:44:17: Joe: That one's bad, even for me 😅 But you pretty :)
15/12/2014 20:46:25: Joe: Just had a pre-tomorrow dinner with all the family. The stories that got told... If you have a dinner with them, you'll probably understand why my sense I humour is sometimes a bit off :)
15/12/2014 20:47:04: Joe: Learned a few things about my dear aunts and uncles tonight
15/12/2014 20:47:15: Joe: How's your evening been? X
15/12/2014 20:49:24: Hayley: Loool!!! 
If you said that to an actual Muslim fundamentalist you would get in trouble!
15/12/2014 20:49:41: Hayley: But thanks for the compliment, I think.. :)
15/12/2014 20:50:48: Hayley: Yeh was gonna ask how dinner went. Hehe sounds like fun! Good that people seem to be in good spirits :)
15/12/2014 20:52:42: Hayley: Evenings been goood. As mentioned, schnitzel was amazing! Then went and wandered around another market, bought the family some gifts. excited about my brothers gift: is a marzipan kartoffel, so it looks like a potato but it's actually a blob of marzipan with some cocoa powder on it... Exciting stuff.
15/12/2014 20:52:52: Hayley: You still at dinner then?
15/12/2014 22:00:46: Joe: I know it's a bit veiled (har har) but it really is a compliment! 😊 
Sometimes I look at you, and I lose my train of thought.
Dinner was pretty great :) Turned up too late for the food, but just in time for the back-pocket special-occasion tales about my family in their teens and twenties. Great to see my Grandad doubled over laughing again :)
The marzipan kartoffeln seems like the perfect mix of disappointment and amazingness. I'm sure he'll hate/love it :)
Drove home, and had a chat with my aunt (the one who I'm seeing for Christmas 😊), had a good natter. She's staying the night, in my brother's room before tomorrow. She seemed a little scarred after some of the stories, actually! 
Now just planing final bits for tomorrow. Apparently I'm now backup in case my cousin can't finish his speech. Gulp
15/12/2014 22:01:44: Joe: So. Many. Typos.
15/12/2014 22:02:00: Joe: It's been a long day! Sorry x
15/12/2014 22:04:19: Hayley: I literally can't see any typos and I've read it twice... But, it's been a long day for me too!
15/12/2014 22:04:43: Hayley: Sounds like a really cool evening, great to hear about the laughing grandad :)
15/12/2014 22:05:16: Hayley: Ooh thats cool! If it comes to that I'll sure you'll do great ;)
15/12/2014 22:05:38: Hayley: Hope your aunt isn't too scarred! You'll have to fill me in on some of those stories!!
15/12/2014 22:07:22: Joe: A very long, very good day by the sounds of things though :)
15/12/2014 22:09:30: Joe: Thanks for the vote of confidence :) Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but it's not such a big problem if it does
15/12/2014 22:11:02: Joe: Will do :) You may think slightly differently of folks after, but it's all good-humoured
15/12/2014 22:11:23: Hayley: I wont think anything cos I haven't met them yet :)
15/12/2014 22:11:38: Joe: Have you got much on the cards for tomorrow, or taking it easy before the journey back? X

15/12/2014 22:17:57: Joe: I know the feeling, but make the most of it! Lots more awesome adventure just waiting to be had :) 
We're meeting for 12, I think it starts officially a bit after 12.30, and moves from the crematorium to a hotel nearby, then to our place in the evening. Of course I don't mind! :)
15/12/2014 22:19:00: Hayley: Ok, thanks.

15/12/2014 22:44:27: Hayley: Yep, good idea!
15/12/2014 22:44:50: Hayley: Thanks joebert, hope tomorrow goes as ok as possible. Love to you and all your family! ❤
15/12/2014 22:45:02: Joe: Thanks for being you (awesome), and for being there for tomorrow. Have fun!
15/12/2014 22:45:15: Hayley: I'll always be there :)
15/12/2014 22:45:51: Joe: Stop being so awesome, I need to sleep!
15/12/2014 22:45:58: Hayley: sozlol
15/12/2014 22:46:09: Hayley: Night joebert X❤x❤X.
15/12/2014 22:46:22: Joe: Night Hayley :) 😍
16/12/2014 08:15:03: Hayley: Good morning joebert! Sorry if it's early. just about to leave the hotel. Will try and give you a call in a bit. Hope you slept ok!
16/12/2014 08:17:43: Hayley: Xxx
16/12/2014 10:25:05: Joe: Thanks for calling earlier :) Glad to talk to you, even if I wasn't very lucid! Really appreciate the support for today. Hope yours goes well too :) x
16/12/2014 11:27:36: Hayley: My pleasure :)
16/12/2014 11:27:41: Hayley: Hope all is going well.xx
16/12/2014 13:49:54: Joe: Funeral's finished now, heading to the hotel for greets. All gone well so fat :) Hope the last day's going well too x
16/12/2014 14:53:40: Hayley: Glad to hear its all going well. Hope everyone's holding up ok. How're you doing?x
16/12/2014 15:47:17: Joe: Everyone just about managed it. I think when other people are struggling a bit, you support them, and don't really think about yourself. Lots of people showed up! It's strange that nearly all of them seemed to recognise my brothers and I. I was clueless :)
Heading home for another hangout now. How's the last day been? X
16/12/2014 15:49:24: Hayley: Yer thats always the way, I found it best to just smile and say how nice it is to see them. Really nice that lots of people turned up :)
16/12/2014 15:50:14: Hayley: Last days ok, although its still ages till the flight but we're both pretty knackered. probs just gonna head to the airport early and see what happens.
16/12/2014 15:50:28: Hayley: Hope the rest of the day goes well!
16/12/2014 16:18:19: Joe: Yeah, that works well :) We had spaces for 100 seated, but probably about fifty were standing. Place was packed out 😊 Lots of stories and laughter, and that carried on after the service too :) Great to see some family friends of ours that you feel like you saw yesterday, had about an hour chatting with one group. 
Glad the last day's gone well, but you do sound like you're quite tired now! Not long until you'll be sleeping in your own bed again :) x
16/12/2014 16:20:11: Joe: Are you chilling in the terminal now? X
16/12/2014 16:21:55: Hayley: Whoa! Thats a great turnout :). Aw thats cool, sounds like it's going as well as these things can :). 

Yay bed!! Just about to leave the hotel for the airport ! Dunno if there'll be WiFi there but hope so!
16/12/2014 16:22:01: Hayley: Will message as soon as I can!
16/12/2014 16:22:09: Hayley: Hope it all carries on going well!
16/12/2014 16:22:23: Hayley: Hugs and kisses!! 😚😚😚😚
16/12/2014 17:52:37: Hayley: At the airport. And there's WiFi :):):) hope all's going well joebert!xx
16/12/2014 17:55:54: Joe: Sweet! All the men seem to have congregated in the living room, watching the Chase and shouting out all the wrong answers :)
16/12/2014 17:56:09: Joe: What time's your flight? :)
16/12/2014 17:59:56: Hayley: Hilarious! The chase is jokes., watched it for the first time rhebither day
16/12/2014 18:00:03: Hayley: 8.45 is the flight
16/12/2014 18:00:23: Hayley: so 7.45 to you :)
16/12/2014 18:01:08: Hayley: Spent all my last euros in duty free... Oops, I expected to bring some home... ah well! Still quite a while so stopped for a bite to eat :)
16/12/2014 18:24:13: Joe: Ah, you'll have a fair old wait! The duty free is a terror. Was it a massive toblerone? I'm always tempted by those :)
16/12/2014 18:25:11: Hayley: Haha nah. Although I was tempted!! More marzipan related paraphernalia I'm afraid :)
16/12/2014 18:27:16: Joe: Surely there's only so much marzipan a person can take?! 
Yeah, I can understand the urge to buy massive toblerones, but the big bags of m&ms confuse me a bit. Why not just buy two bags at home? Anyways...
16/12/2014 18:28:02: Joe: Probably going a bit stir-crazy, we're now watching another quiz show. Eggheads?
16/12/2014 18:28:45: Joe: So what did you get in for the last day? :)
16/12/2014 18:30:20: Hayley: That is where you are rather mistaken my dear joebert!!! 
Hmmm, I think I must be the novelty of the thing, must admit they don't really tempt me either...!
16/12/2014 18:30:28: Hayley: Ah beitza bonce! (Or so my dad calls it...!)  Good show :)
16/12/2014 18:31:15: Joe: An old family friend of our family, a really really Irish priest named Tony is far more entertaining than the TV. I'm enjoying listening to him watch TV more than anything that's on there
16/12/2014 18:31:39: Joe: Is that Hebrew? :)
16/12/2014 18:32:08: Hayley: Haha yeh some of it! Nice one )
16/12/2014 18:32:21: Hayley: And Loool, sounds like something out of father Ted !
16/12/2014 18:34:28: Joe: It is a bit. Had to run to the corner shop a while ago to get him some gin & tonic :)
How's mama? X
16/12/2014 18:34:48: Hayley: DRINK!
16/12/2014 18:34:57: Hayley: FECK!
16/12/2014 18:35:00: Hayley: Etc... Anyway
16/12/2014 18:35:09: Hayley: You mean my mumma? :)
16/12/2014 18:41:04: Hayley: She's good thanks :)
16/12/2014 18:41:10: Hayley: Hows your mamma?
16/12/2014 18:46:50: Joe: Basically! But with a little more Irish charm :)
That's good. I'd imagine you're both pretty exhausted at this point? My mamma's all good, earlier on she had to step in on my Grandad's speech a few words in. She started reading it for him, and her voice started shaking a bit too! She managed to finish it off for him though. I think now everyone's just enjoying each other's company and chilling out a bit. It was a pretty much perfect service, so my mum's been able to let go a bit now x
16/12/2014 18:50:12: Hayley: Aww that's so cute :(. Sounds like she did really well, Can't have been easy.
16/12/2014 18:51:15: Hayley: Glad the service went perfectly :)
16/12/2014 18:52:02: Joe: I'd meant to ask, what's the plan with Sophage & Mehmet? X
16/12/2014 18:52:16: Joe: Thanks :)
16/12/2014 18:58:06: Hayley: Oh, no idea lol!
16/12/2014 18:58:54: Hayley: I'll check with sophag!
16/12/2014 18:58:57: Hayley: But also I remembered were invited to a uni friends Xmas party on Saturday afternoon/evening too... We don't have to go but it might be nice..!
16/12/2014 19:01:37: Joe: Haha! Sounds like we'll be quite busy, then 😃
16/12/2014 19:01:56: Hayley: We don't have to be :)
16/12/2014 19:02:52: Joe: The big family get-together for my family is in East Ham on Sunday too! Going to be Christmas partied out :)
16/12/2014 19:03:06: Joe: No, let's go, if you want to!
16/12/2014 19:03:40: Hayley: Oooh right!
16/12/2014 19:04:20: Hayley: Hmm, well, we're gonna need some of our own chill time too... We'll figure something out :)
16/12/2014 19:04:58: Joe: Everyone's asking me if you're coming to that one, btw. Thought you might want a little more time before that ordeal... :)
16/12/2014 19:05:16: Joe: Although you are more than welcome :)
16/12/2014 19:05:36: Joe: Yeah, we can figure summat
16/12/2014 19:05:48: Joe: 😊
16/12/2014 19:05:55: Hayley: Ahhhh.... Erm... Ermm..... Dunno! Haha
16/12/2014 19:07:17: Joe: Thought it might be a bit much! The chances are, people would be in high interrogation mode :)
16/12/2014 19:08:19: Joe: Probably best to get a little more used to the particular brand of crazy my family specialises in, before trying the Xmas party
16/12/2014 19:08:52: Hayley: As you wish :)
16/12/2014 19:09:12: Joe: I personally think you should come, though :)
16/12/2014 19:11:04: Joe: But I know it's not the best idea :) Maybe the next one, it's like the Super Bowl of awkward questions haha
16/12/2014 19:11:21: Hayley: Lololol
16/12/2014 19:11:32: Hayley: Assss youuuu wishhhhh ;)

16/12/2014 19:14:39: Joe: And we were watching an interview with Cameron Diaz and a young black actress, Father Tony just asked if she was her mum
16/12/2014 19:14:46: Joe: Wasn't joking.
16/12/2014 19:14:57: Hayley: Hilarious!!!

16/12/2014 19:15:23: Hayley: What's the plan?
16/12/2014 19:15:36: Joe: Was just thinking that
16/12/2014 19:16:53: Joe: I'll give it some thought. Maybe a movie? Probably just meet up for a walk and a drink :)
16/12/2014 19:17:07: Hayley: (Btw if I randomly don't respond it's cos I lost signal)
16/12/2014 19:17:19: Joe: Do you have a preference?

16/12/2014 22:25:42: Hayley: It's just all cramped and you could just literally die at any minute... not particularly pleasant.

16/02/2015 16:06:58: Hayley: Well its all competency based, sobi need to find examples of when I've shown these competencies etc..
16/02/2015 16:07:36: Hayley: But I'm not sure i have any good examples!! Especially things like teamwork etc cos i always just work alone...

16/02/2015 18:04:38: Hayley: ❤❤❤
16/02/2015 18:21:57: Hayley: Did you make the train??

17/02/2015 09:30:25: Hayley: Hopefully if i focus today I'll get over it.
17/02/2015 09:30:31: Hayley: Love you ❤
17/02/2015 12:50:41: Joe: A little anxiety's alright, but do remember that you're awesome, and will remain so no matter what happens tomorrow. And even if you have a bad day, it won't actually mean that you're any worse off than before! You're just shopping for the one you want at this point 😁
17/02/2015 12:51:20: Joe: How's the war room faring this morning? Xx
17/02/2015 12:52:59: Hayley: I guess
17/02/2015 12:53:50: Hayley: Tbh I think you were right, two days is a bit too much, it probably just making me worse. I kinda just want to go in there an wing it a bit, that way its more organic!
17/02/2015 12:54:07: Hayley: Hows your day going?x
17/02/2015 12:58:13: Joe: Go for a little walk :) It'll help clear your head. Prepping means you've got hooks to use when improvising. Making sure your head's in the right place is important too.
17/02/2015 12:58:24: Joe: :)
17/02/2015 12:59:18: Joe: Day's going well for me, at the moment still no defects raised on my bit! Hopefully it stays that way. No Samwise for lunch today though :(
17/02/2015 12:59:57: Joe: Which day did we say for Mr Flatley? X
17/02/2015 13:08:36: Hayley: Yeh, that's what I'm thinking, instead if memorizing stuff just develop hook to embellish on! And then what will be will be. I just need to remember to think and consider before I speak
17/02/2015 13:08:53: Hayley: Woo nice one! Sorry about the lack of Sam :(
17/02/2015 13:08:56: Hayley: Erm.... Dunnooo
17/02/2015 13:09:06: Hayley: Do you have a preference?
17/02/2015 13:16:32: Joe: Just keep practicing answers in your head. Try not to skip any or think "I've got that one" - actually say it out loud as you would in the interview. It does help!
17/02/2015 13:17:18: Joe: You'll end up not trying to find AN answer, but having a few things to choose from :)
17/02/2015 13:18:39: Joe: What's your plan now? Maybe just relax for a while. Could have a bath / shower while practicing answers :)

17/02/2015 18:04:44: Hayley: Erm...
17/02/2015 18:04:52: Joe: Not talking about interview prep, I mean the toasts per minute hypothesis
